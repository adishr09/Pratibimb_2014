						<h2>The Drag From The Fag <span>- Anuj Narang, Egon Zehnder</span></h2>
						<p>"Why do you do it? Practising how to poison yourself?"<br>"Calms my mind down. Trims the chaos inside. Say, shall I buy one for you?" <br>"I'm good. I'll just have a drag from your fag."</p>
						<p>That's when it all started. I distinctly remember that dreary night. Sitting on the roadside in our pyjama bottoms we were making small talk about our future, when Shanky got all sappy and lit one. As for me, I only wanted to try it once. I wish I hadn't. Because now, I don't ever leave the house without a packet in the pocket. In no time it turned from a single drag to a lethal habit. A ritual rather. Brushing your teeth in the morning- check. Smoking one after lunch, tea and dinner- check, check and check. Getting chained to this kind of a lifestyle, for one day the ritual breaks, the mind shakes. 'No wonder I'm not able to focus. I didn't have my morning fag.' Without a shadow of doubt - addicted. </p>
						<p>Going by the book, a drug is a substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being. The latter part is something to ponder upon. One simply cannot overlook the ability of nicotine to regulate mood and improve cognitive functioning, which is presumably the motivation for its ubiquitous use. You do get a hit with each puff going inside, sometimes soothing the mind and at times getting the motor running. But there is a broader question at stake here - for how long? And at what cost?</p>
						<p>New definition- a drug is anything that tends to provide short term felicity with no assurance of long-term enhancements. Painkillers, coffee, alcohol, Facebook, fornication and of course, the cigarettes, tend to come under this. One might have profound reasons to take those painkillers. But the same simply cannot be said about alcohol or cigarettes. Try picturing your cigarette as a royal cylindrical palace- ruled over in the inside by the king of addiction - Nicotine, engulfed inside the tobacco. With all the help harvested from his men- the army of toxins, the king shall perform his duty and slowly fulfil the promise made to his people. Grant them death! Make them martyrs. I sincerely believe that somewhere inside the heart of hearts of those sailing in the same boat as me, lurks fear - fear of the repercussions to be followed - the cancers, the ulcers and the ruined teeth to name a few. Yet we seldom have a problem in turning a blind eye to them, and shamelessly indulge in the act, daily. Many a time. Why? The truth is that most of us are oblivious of the extent of addiction. We keep assuming we can discontinue at will but somehow don’t want to at the moment. Moreover, we are always looking for reasons to continue doing it, or to rather not quit. Most common ones being- 'I want to smoke my sorrows away', 'helps me think more clearly', 'my life is too stressful' or the most recent one I heard- 'Lord Shiva used to smoke, why can’t I? (Courtesy: The Shiva Trilogy). Trust me, that'd be the Nicotine talking. Try quitting for a week and the reality might dawn on you eventually.</p>
						<p>Ridding yourself from this addiction is not as straightforward as the non-smokers think it is. The king just does not let his people elude that easily. 90% of the smokers, in their life, have some day or the other thought of not smoking eventually having turned up with a cigarette in their mouth late in the very same day, turning into a lone wolf smoking in peace, fretting about the past or brooding over the future.</p>
						<p>My father once said to me- "no man who has ever indulged in this practice can ever be the man he once was". But he can better his present, only if he wants to. How a smoker friend of mine in Lucknow and I have decided to tackle our current situation is to firstly reduce it by 50% a day. On not being able to hold one's horses and smoking the next one, one would have to telephone the other and apologize with all the shame and guilt in the world, the act being repeated as many times as the number of fags smoked upwards of the number after the reduction. The cycle is to be repeated each week till we get down to 1 a day and finally calling it quits. </p>
						<p>And if that sounds too much of hard work, one can always switch to the relatively less harmful e-cigarettes. With persistence and professional health, this trap of an addiction can be overcome. A penny's worth of advice to all the non-smokers out there- there does exist a simple, decent and serene procedure of quitting or not indulging in smoking. Do not start it in the first place. Simply avoid that first drag from that fag.</p>

						<h2>Speak Up..!!<span>-	Megha Vishwanath, Source: Storypick</span></h2>
						<p>It was a Saturday afternoon I had lunch with a friend in Gurgaon before I decided to head home. The metro for those who do not take it or belong to Delhi can get crowded and air tight to an extent that the Tupperware guys could take inspiration. I luckily managed to find a seat till Rajiv Chowk metro station (Connaught Place) where I had to change my train. The doors opened… By the way, I was in a regular and not the women’s only coach – why is this little detail important for this post? Well the answer lies ahead.</p>
						<p>So where were we? Yes, the doors opened and people began to flood in. I tried to push and nudge my way out but no luck. With a huge sigh I decided to get off at the next station - New Delhi. As I positioned myself close to the exit door I felt a sense of unease run through my body, like someone has pierced their gaze on me or someone is watching me. Suddenly I felt something touch me from behind. With half my mind on trying to get off at the next station I turned thinking it was someone’s bag or hand touching me repeatedly. I turned to see a man in a white kurta (long shirt) staring right at me and he had no baggage with him. In fact both his hands were clenching the railing next to him. But if both his hands were up there what was it that… I got my answer as soon as I lowered my sight. There beneath that long shirt I could clearly see that this man was UNZIPPED. I felt the blood rush to my head, boiling and fuming and fury ran through every nerve in my body.</p>
						<p>Within that fraction of a second every single eve teasing incident, every darn face of those guys who had the guts to molest someone I know flashed through my mind. Before I knew my voice escaped my lungs and there I was screaming at the man who dared to mess with me.</p>
						<p>‘KYA problem hai?’ (What is your problem?)<br>‘Kya samjh rakha hai saale?’ (What the hell do you think?)<br>‘Himmat kaise huyi teri?’ (How dare you?)</p>
						<p>These were some of the things I uttered looking right into his eyes. He was startled and started blabbering that he is sorry and insisted that it was his hand that touched me by mistake. Your ‘HAND’ that comes out from your pants? How the hell was your zip open? I was screaming in a coach full of men and women. Did anyone come forward to help or even displayed basic courtesy to ask me what was wrong? The answer was a big, unsurprising NO. I turned and spotted two men in fact smirking at me. Their silence tried my patience and ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.</p>
						<p>I held that (namesake) man’s collar and dragged him out of the train. He was on a loop mode ‘It was my hand, it was a crowded train’. The moment we set foot at the platform he managed to escape. I ran, with all the strength and courage in me, I ran after him making as much noise as I could. A few saw (the tamasha), the others gasped while one man in the uniform began to chase him. I went towards the other side and we managed to get hold of him. I yelled again, “How dare you? How did you dare to touch me? People like you make Delhi a nightmare for girls? You make us question every time before we step a foot outside. HOW DARE YOU?”</p>
						<p>People watched the guards dragging a man to the control room and a girl screaming at him. They only watched.</p>
						<p>As we took him to the control room he told the police that I am mistaken, it was his hand that touched me by mistake and it could happen to anyone because it was a crowded train. “Ask her… it was my hand”, he said. 15 guards, all men turned towards me as he tried to shame me. But if he had the guts to do it I had the spine to say it. You see anger brings out the strength you never thought you had in you but in my case anger brought out a language I never thought I could use. I was outright and I had all the right to be – “Lift up that kurta and you will know exactly what touched me”. There. I said it out loud and clear. The guards felt outraged and charged at him. Within seconds he begged for forgiveness and suddenly the hand in question transformed into a part of his body he wished he never had. “Why would this girl lie? After all she is taking the blame on herself”, said the police officer to the criminal in front of me. He committed the crime, I raised my voice and yet somehow the shame was on me. That statement reflected the thought process of our society, in fact it said much more. I argued with the officer and told the man in question that I have lost NOTHING in this entire episode and in fact I will make him pay for this. He immediately begged for forgiveness and I instead, insisted to file an FIR. After a few calls, 5 friends of mine reached the station to back me up and how? They were equally angered and showed no mercy.</p>
						<p>We moved to Kashmere Gate police station and I slapped a sexual molestation case against him. He was arrested and put behind bars immediately. I decided to not let this one go and appeared at the court on Monday to record my statement in front of the magistrate. Meanwhile this man has been moved to Tihar jail and will spend his time behind the bars until he gets bail.</p>
						<p>You see there are several measures being taken to make our public spots and transport safe. Someone asked me as to why I did not take the women’s only coach? But honestly that’s not a solution. These reservations in fact paint the idea that it is not ok or safe for women to be in public spaces. It's debatable, I know but are reservations really improving the situation? Then what would?</p>
						<p>I think the answer lies within us. Unless women put forward that is not OKAY for someone to touch and get away with it, nothing will change.</p>
						<p>I could just bite the bullet and accept that I was eve teased or molested. Or I can raise my voice and instil the fear in the criminal instead of victimising myself. If this man has the guts to unzip in a metro full of people, he probably started off by doing something less offensive to another girl. Her silence was his encouragement. Remember every time you choose to ignore or walk away, you put someone else in danger.</p>
						<p>So I urge women to respect their body and know that it’s okay for you to say that someone touched you without your consent and you have to muster the courage to reach out to the police. I insist please for the sake of womanhood – SPEAK UP!</p>

						<h2>Being Gay A Crime!!<span>-Apporva Singhal, Vellore Institute of Technology</span></h2>
						<p>Ask anyone about how they feel about the concept of ‘love’, and I bet they won’t be able to stop themselves from uttering the words “Awww…it is beautiful!”</p>
						<p>Yes they believe in love, they want it, they appreciate it, they like it, but only as long as it is between two opposite sexes. Why? We are still living in a world where people are repelled, disgusted and completely against homosexuals. All these phobias make sense to me except this one called homophobia. I feel it is completely irrational to have prejudices and discriminations against people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.</p>
						<p>The kind of reactions and insults they have to suffer are unimaginable. People literally run away when they spot a gay couple around. They would constantly stare at them and make them feel awkward as if they have come from another world. This feeling of alienation is found in almost every homosexual. And this attitude is being passed on from generations since kids are not any less afraid of homosexuality. There are cases of children screaming and being petrified of these people. This is not their fault since this mind set has been in existence for ages. There is an urgent need for this looking down upon homosexual behavior to change.</p>
						<p>Judge a person by what they do and not by who they love. If there is a right to education, a freedom to speech, I think it is high time we have a ‘freedom to love who ever we want’. We need to empathize with them since they are normal human beings like us. They deserve better than what they are getting right now. Imagine yourself getting up one morning and being looked down upon and hated by the world just based on your choice of being with the person you love. It seems unfair, doesn’t it! Well then let us change this set attitude and thinking for the better. Let us all give them a reason to believe that world after all is not that cruel a place.</p>

						<h2>Worship A Goddess or Warship For A Girl?<span>- Rhea Chawla, Hindu College</span></h2>
						<p>I am sick, tired and disappointed with the dichotomy that follows the love of women in our land. The land of beauty and the land of down fall. The land of rich heritage and the land of poor laws. It's heart breaking how we refer to women as the Goddesses of everything important. Goddess of Love, of Education, of Honesty, of Mankind, of Sexuality, of Dreams, of Money, of Being.</p>
						<p>The birth of a daughter in homes is welcomed by cries of the Goddess Lakshmi blessing the house with her benign presence. And the men of the house rape the Goddess of the neighbouring home.</p>
						<p>I am sorry if anything I write in this post annoys or makes some people of the society feel like I have violated their morals but this is the harsh reality, the truth we are so scared of saying in the open, afraid that the same Goddesses might feel offended and bring bad will upon us.</p>
						<p>If you and I could stop a crime, what would it be? Murder? Rape? Robbery? I would choose robbery. Robbery of a girl's soul, the idea of her being, the spirit of her existence. I want to stop the robbing of morals of our society and I want to stop the deferring of punishment to these robbers.</p>
						<p>Rapists can have a million excuses. Being brought up in a state of abject poverty, no education, and deprivation of basic means of survival. But in my eyes NOTHING gives them the right to go out on the street and RAPE a girl. Steal the one thing she has that nobody will respect her without.</p>
						<p>The second thing that irks me so much. The mentality of the people WE very staunchly elect (or not elect because some people do not recognize their right to vote as important) to the ruling seats. The defence lawyer, (the statement of whom actually made me so mad and want to write this) in the Nirbhaya, 16 December rape case says, "I would burn my daughter to death if she would go around having pre-marital sex and go out at night with her boyfriend".</p>
						<p>For one, I am so disappointed that God decided to bless him with a daughter. Secondly, if a daughter has been living with him all these years, why has she failed to change her own father's thinking? If her father would have seen his daughter as the girl who can stand up to any guy, make her own decisions, he would probably have been forced to eat up his own words, but NO. That wouldn't happen for the 'poor' girl shall be the subject of her father's orthodox mentality till she gets married and then of her husband's and then her son's and so on and so forth.</p>
						<p>Disappointing.</p>
						<p>Why don't the women realize? Unless you are willing to stand up for yourself, no one will be willing to help you! We are the people and it takes the people to bring about a revolution! If today we decide to not sit quiet and be the silent sufferers of crimes on our souls, nothing can stop us. Empower yourself to empower the nation! Take it one step at a time. Help a poor girl understand her place in this world, her rights; give her education and help her reach out for all she deserves in this big world. It doesn't take a lot. It takes time and some old books. Or just 5 rupees a month to make sure they go to the Government school round the block. If you don't wake up today, tomorrow another girl is going to be the sheep of man's animalistic lust.</p>
						<p>The cruel truth isn't it. We'll respect them in temples and want them in our beds in the evenings.</p>
						<p>Anger is not my only cause of writing this in plain words. It's the urgency, the need of something to GET DONE. DO IT.</p>

						<h2>Notion of Beauty & Popular Media<span>-Srishti Chaudhary, JMC</span></h2>
						<p>Beauty as a notion or phenomenon is so broadly implicit, that it can almost be understood as a Jungian archetype, a collectively inherited unconscious idea, universally present in individual thought. To define beautiful is difficult, as its implications are always assumed to be easily understood, that no further explanation is required, just as one would describe something as ‘nice’. </p>
						<p>Oxford defines beauty as something that pleases the senses aesthetically, with a special emphasis on sight. From this very point, the concept of something or someone as beautiful took on a very specific framework. While a difference between being beautiful and looking beautiful is well-recognized, the conventional tint through which beauty is viewed is efficiently in place. This tint, which is now an evocative machinery in the mind, has been largely sourced from what came to be known, as the third millennium rolled around, the popular culture and media. </p>
						<p>Edmund Burke, political theorist and philosopher, had noticed that the press, or the media, encouraged everyone, to develop opinions on everything. While this may seem an obvious thing to state, this extensive development and echoing of public opinion has led to every individual forming certain views, which are tallied with their past experiences and systems of morality, about anything that can be discussed. The media and the popular culture produced and reproduced their version of ‘the beautiful’, and once all this infinite information is as boundlessly disseminated as this, ideas about what is beautiful are created, reiterated and permanently sketched. </p>
						<p>Aristotle’s Golden Mean, which is considered as the perfect indication of what is beautiful, is present in face and body structures, and the more a structure complies to the golden mean, the more beautiful it is considered. So while there is still some consensus on what is beautiful, the popular media has acted like a very effective agent to promote very precise and definite ideas about what is beautiful. </p>
						<p>In fact, so effective is this agent that notions of beauty evolve exactly as how the popular media wants them to evolve. So while the later decades of the 20th century emphasized a curvaceous figure among women as beautiful, presently, prominent cheekbones, collarbones and smaller structures are considered to be pre-requisites for beauty. As different cultures are exposed to different art, the notions of beauty also vary. What is thought to be beautiful aesthetically in African countries may be very different from the same notion in France, or maybe south of India. But just as in everything else, the domination of the western ideals of beauty have pervaded other places on the globe. Attempting to create a uniform image of something which is as diverse as beauty is simply unhealthy. </p>
						<p>These notions, thanks to the vetting out by the popular media too, are insidious, causing people to behave in compliance with them. A conscious attempt to realize oneself of the complexities of beauty, and how no one idea can define what is beautiful, needs to be continuously made, and only then these can be overcome.</p>
