						<h2>A Good Manager<span>Pulkit Sharma,EEE 2nd year, BVCOE</span></h2>
						<p>“Leadership is doing the right things, Management is doing the things right” - Peter Drucker</p>
						<p>Leadership of course is a quality necessary to catalyze a team’s progress, but is efficient leadership enough for organizational success? The answer is NO. Solely, leadership qualities might even instigate “cathedra mea regulae meae” attitude. Adept leadership might be important for energizing & mobilizing the team but management is the quality that sails the team through. Need for smooth structural functioning necessitates -effective Management. </p>
						<p>A lot of people have their desktops and drawers cluttered with random stuff; junk they might not even require for quite long or possibly might not need them at all. By not paying attention to this disorganization of their items they might pretend to have saved time but they will actually have prolonged their tasks every time they go through all that debris to find something. The same is applicable to all aspects of our lives, be it while managing time or while setting one’s priorities, managing academic goals or managing a team at professional front. The things that we need to sort out this junk and mess off our lives and set our priorities straight, are deciphered as efficient managerial capabilities.</p>
						<center><img src="img/1_1.png" style="margin:10px 0;"></center>
						<p>While discussing effective management qualities, a debate often finds some room as to whether a manager is born-manager or nurtured? "A proficient manager is not made but born a manager” a person not so perspective would say might even use it as an excuse throughout his life. The Claims that great managers have their brains differently wired to others are common, thus disregarding the notion that skills can be taught or acquired. However a sagacious person will tell you- nobody is born with managerial abilities, nobody is born with ability to tackle issues or manage situations. They are the qualities that one acquires while growing, this is the growth which goes on throughout life, 'evolution' as we may call it. Talking of evolution, it depends on choices we make and opportunities that we grab on to. Managerial qualities, hence is harmless to say, are nurtured along time through the choices we make and opportunities we take. Cultivating management capabilities involves evolving ones abilities in right direction. Right direction can be characterized by three initial steps, first, saying yes to opportunities with belief in oneself. Second, being always ready to learn, Learning is the process that should never cease, nobody is ever old enough to know everything, and quest for knowing that ‘everything’ is catalyst to one's evolution. Third, Never wasting time, that is, even if there is ample of time to spare instead using that precious period for self reflection and conversing with own self, as suggests Robin Sharma in ‘Leader who had no title’.</p>

						<h2>Mumbai Dabbawalas<span>Samridhi Jain,2nd year, SRCC</span></h2>
						<p>Clad in their traditional outfits and Gandhi caps, the 5000 or so dabbawalas in Mumbai transport around 2,00,000 lunchboxes through the city on every working day. That means conducting of 4,00,000 transactions in six hours each day, six days a week, 52 weeks a year.</p>
						<p>The dabbawalas have been in business for around 100 years. These dabbawalas basically carry lunchboxes from their customers’ homes to their offices and return the boxes to their homes after the lunch hour. But why are their services required ? The reason is the crowded local trains of Mumbai which make it difficult to carry lunchboxes in the rush hour. So the dabbawalas carry their lunchboxes for them after the morning rush hour so that people can enjoy homemade food without worrying about carrying the lunchboxes to and fro their workplaces. </p>
						<p>The management system of the Mumbai dabbawalas has been a topic for study for last few years. How these scarcely literate people have such an efficient delivery system that they have been awarded the Six Sigma certificate has been a topic on which various research papers, articles, books have been written. Their business practices are included in a subject in Graduate School of Journalism at University of California, Berkeley.  They have been invited for lectures by IIM (Ahemedabad), IIM ( Lucknow), Chartered Accountants Chapter (Dubai) and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) Conferences. They have a documentary made on their work by the Carnegie Mellon Professor Paul Goodman and a Harvard Business School Case Study.</p>
						<h6>Structure</h6>
						<p>To perform their work most efficiently, the dabbawalas have organized themselves into roughly 200 units of about 25 people each. These small groups have local autonomy. Such a flat organizational structure is perfectly suited to providing a low-cost delivery service.</p>
						<h6>Process</h6>
						<p>On any given day, a dabba changes hands several times. In the morning a worker picks it up from the customer’s home and takes it (along with other dabbas) to the nearest train station, where it is sorted according to its destination. It is then taken by train to the station closest to its destination. There it is sorted again and assigned to another worker, who delivers it to the right office before lunchtime. In the afternoon the process runs in reverse.The dabbas have basic codes indicating the neighborhood where the lunchbox needs to be delivered, the person who will make the delivery and the building and floor </p>
						<center><img src="img/2_1.png" width="500px" height="420px" style="margin:10px 0;"></center>
						<h6>Management</h6>
						<p>The dabbawalas essentially manage themselves with respect to hiring, logistics, customer acquisition and retention, and conflict resolution.</p>
						<p>When someone wants to join a local dabbawala group, the group will assess whether there’s enough demand to add another person. New hires are trained on the job by the group. They learn to assist in all activities. After a probation period of six months, they can buy into the business with a sum equal to 10 times their expected monthly income. So, for example, if a new hire expects to make 7,000 rupees a month at a particular unit, then he would need 70,000 rupees to become an equity partner who would share in the profits.</p>
						<p>Workers with more than 10 years of experience serve as supervisors, or muqaddams. Every group has one or more muqaddams, who supervise the coding, sorting, and loading and unloading of dabbas and are responsible for resolving disputes, overseeing collections, and troubleshooting. They also pick up and deliver dabbas themselves. Members elect representatives from among the muqaddams to serve on two managing committees that meet monthly to tackle operational and organizational issues as well as problems that cannot be resolved at the local level.</p>
						<p>The dabbawalas’ success is proof that with the right system in place, ordinary workers can achieve extraordinary results. Many lessons can be learned by the future managers from the overall management system of the dabbbawalas which works with one simple goal: delivering food on time, every time.</p>

						<h2>My Story<span>Hemangini Malhotra, BVCOE</span></h2>
						<p>So, after clearing all the hurdles of being a science student, clearing the entrances and finally getting into a reputed college, I thought it's finally over! Yes, the feeling of accomplishment was just coming. See? All that was worth it, I can sense the freedom in me. Now, I can do whatever I want, I am not supposed to attend the classes, I can have fun, and score well too. I had always thought that I would want to write articles, express myself, play badminton, sing and the endless list of hobbies made me happier because I thought now is the time. With all those hopes of getting out of the two year old nerdi-ness, as I entered the college, people came in telling me that now that you are in college, you have to focus on your career, as this is the stepping stone to the ladder of success. You need to join the societies, work there to enhance your skills, learn both on a technical as well as personal front, and score well, because that's how you are going to get a good company to hire you. But, it's going to be better they said, you will have fun in college, they said. Studies are much easier here, they said. Well, I believed in probably everything at the time. But, as it is well said, "You can't have your cake and eat it too". Slowly, I got enrolled in a few societies, thinking that hobbies are important but so is my placement. I started to miss my classes thinking that studies are not that of a big deal. I met new people and made new friends. Surely I learned a lot. This is fun!</p>
						<p>Then, one day I saw the notice board had a detention list (I swear, I had never heard of it. I didn’t even know that such things exist). To my surprise, I saw my name in it. Okay, so I realized after a while that aside from everything I missed, there was just another word that scared the hell out of people. ATTENDANCE! What was even worse, they were going to call my parents, and let them know about the same. Now that was so rude! I mean whatever happened to us being adults? Why didn’t I know about this before? Okay, I started to lose my mind. I wasn't sure what to do. So I went over to the teachers. With a little bit of sweet-talk; they gave me an alternate way of skipping the detention. I was supposed to attend all the classes, even the tutorials, the labs! </p>
						<p>Woah, that was just too much for me to take.  Anyways, after attending all the lectures and pathetic tutorials to cover my attendance, I realized it’s time to balance things. I didn’t want to miss on the fun stuff you see! </p>
						<center><img src="img/3_1.png" style="margin:10px 0;"></center>
						<p>So, usually the obvious step is to probably make a timetable. Since, I am in college, by now I was familiar with the fact that timetables are meant to be broken. Seriously, Come on. We don't even follow the college timetable. How can you expect anyone to follow the one made by themselves. So, firstly I made up my mind to do the work for a society only when I have a free lecture. I did attend all the important classes. I set my priorities on the basis of the deadlines I was given. In the start, all this made me crazy! But, I had to do it. After sometime, I saw that things have finally started to fall into place. It got a bit monotonous too. So, I wanted to fit-in my hobbies as they are the best ways to rejuvenate.</p>
						<p>The sports week was approaching, and the notice board had it written all over. I saw the badminton trials notice, I just couldn't stop myself. I got selected in the round 1, that kind of made me happy, then the round 2, 3 , and so on!(there were 90+ registrations, so..).Thankfully, we were given an O.D. (On Duty), so that turned out well. Of course, I won (This is my article, what do you expect me to write?). The true sense of accomplishment came when I realized, that I was able to play badminton, complete the society work, attend my lectures, complete the cursed file work. So basically, it probably took me a semester to realize how to manage things. The only key is to take things slowly, and fit them in. And the proof is, after everything, I have had this time to write an article. </p>
						<p>So just take things as they come, and judge them whether what priority they deserve, all that will do the deed! Have fun, because, well, practically IT'S NEVER OVER! You will always have a lot on your plate. But, you will be a true winner only when you have fun, relax and learn! It's all about how you take it. It's all about the perspective, because stressing over everything is not going to help. You sure as hell don't want to waste your time to plan in how to get things done, rather than doing them now and save the rest of the time to go on a spree! Good luck.</p>

						<h2>Procrastination<span>Shreshtha Jain, EEE 2nd  year,BVCOE</span></h2>
						<p>Procrastination. The word sounds heavy right? But this is a very common problem we are facing today. Google defines Procrastination as the practice of carrying out less urgent tasks in preference to more urgent ones, or doing more pleasurable things in place of less pleasurable ones, and thus putting off impending tasks to a later time, sometimes to the "last minute" before the deadline. In simpler words, “Delaying”. Even after knowing the importance of the work that we have to do and also that it cannot be ignored, if we leave it for tomorrow we procrastinate. Every procrastinator has his own reason to delay the work. Some say that they work better under pressure or simply that they are just too lazy. Procrastination is not just a time management problem it is also a psychological one. It also leads to many health problems related to immune system like frequent flu and cold. And it is quite obvious that a procrastinator can never work well in a team because their responsibility usually shifts to the other member burdening him and making them resentful of him. So if you are procrastinating, start working on ways to stop it. Take the very first step, accept the fact that you are procrastinating. For example, if you are taking up less important task instead of an important one or just waiting for the right mood to do the work. But remember delaying unimportant work is not procrastinating. After that, find out why are you procrastinating? Is it the task which is just too boring or are you unorganised?</p>
						<center><img src="img/4_1.png" style="margin:10px 0;"></center>
						<p>Whatever the reason may be, find a solution. If the work is boring then do it early, complete it fast and get over it. A basic problem with the people delaying their work is that they fool themselves by finding different reasons to do the same. Stop doing this.  Instead motivate yourself to do the work in time. Like you can reward yourself if you complete a particular task without delaying it. Or ask your best friend to keep a check on you. It really works! Organise yourself, make a to-do list, set up your time bound goals and don’t hover over everything. Instead, stick to one work at a time.</p>
						<p>Stop estimating how unpleasant the work could be just go and give it a shot, and who knows? You may enjoy it. And then the most important point, while taking crucial decision don’t be afraid of making the wrong choices. Take up decisions, be confident and have faith in yourself.</p>
