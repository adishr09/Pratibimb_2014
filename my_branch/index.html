                  <h2 style = "text-align:justify">Fresh On Campus 2014<span><br>Naman Sharma</span></h2>
                  <p style = "text-align:justify;">Fresh on Campus, an informal welcome for Freshers, organised on 27 August, 2014 by BVPIEEE, was a huge success in terms of participation and response. It was the second edition of Fresh On Campus, the inagural event being a huge success in 2013. It was singularly aimed at introducing IEEE and its Student Branch, serendipitously also bridging the gap between seniors and freshers by giving them a chance to meet and interact outside of the formal confines of the classroom. There were as many as three activities organised especially for this event. The first among them being, a Plantation Drive, which is an initiative taken up by BVPIEEE, in order to make the campus cleaner and greener. The Plantation Drive had active participation from teachers as well as students of the college. Mr Daman Sood, who is a renowned member of the IEEE Delhi Section Computer Scociety also graced the occcasion with his presence. The next activity organised was a social upliftment initiative by IEEE in the form of Toy Donation for underpriveleged kids. This  too was a huge success, with BVPIEEE managing to collect a substantial number of toys and books for chidren. The final and easily the most popular activity was the ICE BREAKER event, where a list of tasks was handed over to previously decided, groups of students, each group having not more than 5 participants. It was ensured though, that no two participants were from same the branch so that the first year students got a chance to interact with freshers from other branches. Tasks included finding various things on campus, which a Fresher wouldn’t easily be able to spot in the first go, clicking particular pictures and many more fun filled activities. While the participants showed incredible enthusiasm for the only event of its kind; so did the volunteers. The whole BVPIEEE committee effectively managed the event, handling the turnout of more than a 150, which in itself is no mean feat. It highly encouraged freshers to learn more about IEEE and its events at Student Branch level, effect of which was observed in the events that followed.</p>

                  <p style = "text-align:justify">The Industrial Application Society(IAS)  interaction session was held on November 26th,2014 (Wednesday) at IIT, Delhi by Dr. Blake Lloyd, President, IAS(IEEE) , accompanied by Dr. Peter Magyar IAS CMD Chair. The session comprised of a faculty interactive session/ lecture scheduled between 11:00a.m to 12:00 noon, followed by a lab visit (12:00 noon-1:00pm).</p>
                  <p style = "text-align:justify">The session started with Prof.(Dr.) Subrata Mukhopadhyay  (IEEE IAS executive board(2014-15)) addressing the gathering and welcoming Dr. Blake and Dr. Peter on their  9days trip to India. Mr. Blake Lloyd,the president,further talked about the initial founding days of the society. He discussed about the scope of IAS, as a transnational organisation in the advancement of theory, practice, manufacture and development of electrical systems.  The president showed how the society is, in itself different from other IEEE societies in terms of giving industrial exposure to its members, along with opportunities to meet, talk, discuss with other researchers and industry experts in the field itself. Moreover, he highlighted the opportunities its members can avail , which include informative meetings, seminars, conferences, workshops along with professional publications.</p>
                  <p style = "text-align:justify">The session was carried forward by Dr. Peter who discussed about the statistics, comprising of the growth rate, number of members, events, sister societies, etc. , broadcasting the regions from R-1 to R-10, and their subsequent growth in the past years(esp. India in R-10 region). The stats clearly showed how the North American based society has progressed in the past years and spread its wings across the globe. This is the reason that today there is a 50/50 balance between North America and rest of world memberships.</p>
                  <p style = "text-align:justify">At last, he thanked all invities for their support in taking the society across 11,000 members(and counting), especially  the sudden increasing participation from R-10 region(comprising of India).

Although the participation were only three but as soon as the competition started the crowd gathered around the court to watch the robots tear each other apart. The crowd started hooting as the robots hustled and tried to throw each other out of the arena. Two of the participants ended up quitting the competition because of the heat of the competition and the fear of their robots being destroyed. It was surely one of the best robotics competition of BVEST 2014.</p>

                     BVPIEEE and its HKN chapter, the Lambda Eta Chapter, celebrated IEEE Day in October, 2014 with enthusiasm and fervour. The event marked the inauguration of its flagship event ‘IEEE-HKN Research Mentorship Program’. The program aims to bridge the gap between student and faculty members by providing students a platform to excel in the Research and Development (R&D) Department with the help of expert faculty members. The program was inaugurated by our esteemed guest Mr. Manoj Sharma of ECE Department who delivered a session on “Scope of writing a Research Paper”. Around 50 students participated in the inauguration program and were eager to be a part of the program in future. The session concluded with doubt session and feedback from students. 
                     <br/><br/>
                     A robotics event named 'RoboBall' was also organized. The aim of the event was to disseminate freshers to a competition of Robotics, where the challenge was to balance a ball on a wireless bot through a devious track. The one who took the least time and balanced the ball on the bot was the winner of the competition. The event saw a participation of 50 students, even the non-fanatics of robotics joining in to learn something new. 
                     <br/><br/>A photowalk was organised by the Digital Arts Society (DAS) of BVCOE. The aim of this event was to make the freshers aware of a photography technique called Levitation and make them acquainted with the basic rules of how it is implemented. Levitation is the rising of human body into the air by mystical means. More than 70 photography enthusiasts participated in the event and the organizers garnered a positive feedback from the participants. 
                     <br/><br/>A toy-collection drive, an initiative introduced by BVPIEEE in August 2014, was also taken up at IEEE Day. The proceeds of the drive will go to Akshay Pratishthan, an NGO, and it is a small way for the students to give back to the society. 
                     <br/><br/>Team BVPIEEE also organized a Hand printing activity. Students gathered in enthusiasm to participate in this convivial celebration, stamping their handprints with their favourite colours as the IEEE Day cheer spread across the college.

The term light painting also encompasses images lit from outside the frame with hand-held light sources. This technique was carried out by students using their smartphones. All students downloaded apps in their phones which helped them to control their shutter speed. After this, a source of light (here a torch) was moved around by them and they were able to trace the path of light.
                     <br/><br/>Panoramic photography is a technique of photography, using specialized equipment or software that captures images with elongated fields of view. It is sometimes known as wide format photography. During the Drishti panoramas weren’t taught by using a app in the student’s smart phones. The technique used was to take a series of shots by moving our camera about a horizontal straight line. Then these pics were merged into Photoshop giving a perfect panoramic shot.
                     <br/><br/>Turnout: Over 25 students turned up for the workshop. All of them were people having a passion for photography who loved taking pics from their smartphones.

Statistics bear out the enormous response that was received as more than 150 ardent teams participated – most of them comprising of two members each, barring some lone wolves who battled like a one-man army. Prizes up to Rs. 10,000 were up for grabs.

Out of the 150 participating teams, 30 qualified. From the top 30, the top 6 teams were selected. And after a tough battle of brains, the top 3 position holders were announced. The top three teams that made it to the podium after dodging the questions were:
