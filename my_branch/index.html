It is an initiative by IEEE Delhi Section on the lines of the IEEE All India Student Congress(AISC). The main motive of DSC is to improve networking across student branches within the Delhi section and the student branch of BVCOE took active part throughout the Congress making better interactions with student branches accross Delhi.</p>
						<p>Having previously been hosted by IEEE NSIT Student Branch and IEEE JMI Student Branch at their respective institutions, IEEE DTU Student Branch was given the responsibility of hosting DSC 2015 and BVPIEEE took immense pleasure in congratulating the student branch of IEEEDTU for a good show. </p>
						<p>It was an enriching experience for BVPIEEE as the student branch took home new friends; colleagues; lots of knowledge; and industrial exposure. Panel and general discussions among the attendees could make the Delhi Section as a whole aware of the issues with their co-branches in Delhi. It was a platform to discuss issues, share grievances and take steps for implementation of their feasible solutions for betterment of IEEE Delhi Section.</p>
						<p>Day 1, 10 January 2015<br/>Day-1 of the Congress started with the registrations of the attendees who were each given the congress kits. It was followed by a group activity aimed at improving the interaction of the attendees with people NOT belonging to their own student branches. The participants were distributed into teams and each team was allotted one volunteer. Each team, moderated by their volunteer, played a game called ‘What If?’ which was based on situational questions. Members from BVPIEEE took active part in the interactive activity and proved to be among the most aware student branches of Delhi section.</p>

						<h2>Fresh On Campus 2014<span>Naman Sharma</span></h2>
						<p>Fresh on Campus, an informal welcome for Freshers, organised on 27 August, 2014 by BVPIEEE, was a huge success in terms of participation and response. It was the second edition of Fresh On Campus, the inagural event being a huge success in 2013. It was singularly aimed at introducing IEEE and its Student Branch, serendipitously also bridging the gap between seniors and freshers by giving them a chance to meet and interact outside of the formal confines of the classroom. There were as many as three activities organised especially for this event. The first among them being, a Plantation Drive, which is an initiative taken up by BVPIEEE, in order to make the campus cleaner and greener. The Plantation Drive had active participation from teachers as well as students of the college. Mr Daman Sood, who is a renowned member of the IEEE Delhi Section Computer Scociety also graced the occcasion with his presence. The next activity organised was a social upliftment initiative by IEEE in the form of Toy Donation for underpriveleged kids. This  too was a huge success, with BVPIEEE managing to collect a substantial number of toys and books for chidren. The final and easily the most popular activity was the ICE BREAKER event, where a list of tasks was handed over to previously decided, groups of students, each group having not more than 5 participants. It was ensured though, that no two participants were from same the branch so that the first year students got a chance to interact with freshers from other branches. Tasks included finding various things on campus, which a Fresher wouldn’t easily be able to spot in the first go, clicking particular pictures and many more fun filled activities. While the participants showed incredible enthusiasm for the only event of its kind; so did the volunteers. The whole BVPIEEE committee effectively managed the event, handling the turnout of more than a 150, which in itself is no mean feat. It highly encouraged freshers to learn more about IEEE and its events at Student Branch level, effect of which was observed in the events that followed.</p>

The students showed keen interest in the activities of these SIGs with Student Representatives having to stay back, overtime to answer all their questions.
<br/><br/>Lambda Eta Chapter of IEEE-HKN also gave a presentation explaining the benefits of being associated with an honour society to students. Presentation also highlighted Outstanding Chapter award won by Lambda Eta Chapter, Arizona Student Leadership Conference 2013, R10 Conference held in Hyderabad, Cognizance (E-newsletter of Lambda Eta Chapter) and various campus activities like Student Mentorship Programme and Plantation drive.
<br/><br/>One of BVPIEEE’s new initiatives, the technical chapter of RAS (Robotics and Automation Society), was also introduced and its benefits and mission discussed in length along with an interactive demonstration. 
<br/><br/>The event served its purpose of introducing IEEE, the world’s largest professional organization, and its student branch of BVCOE, to the audience and highlighting the diverse membership benefits.

						<h2>IEEE DAY 2014 AT BVCOE <span></span></h2>
						<p>
						 
 <br/>
BVPIEEE and its HKN chapter, the Lambda Eta Chapter, celebrated IEEE Day in October, 2014 with enthusiasm and fervour. The event marked the inauguration of its flagship event ‘IEEE-HKN Research Mentorship Program’. The program aims to bridge the gap between student and faculty members by providing students a platform to excel in the Research and Development (R&D) Department with the help of expert faculty members. The program was inaugurated by our esteemed guest Mr. Manoj Sharma of ECE Department who delivered a session on “Scope of writing a Research Paper”. Around 50 students participated in the inauguration program and were eager to be a part of the program in future. The session concluded with doubt session and feedback from students. 
 
     <br/><br/>
 A robotics event named 'RoboBall' was also organized. The aim of the event was to disseminate freshers to a competition of Robotics, where the challenge was to balance a ball on a wireless bot through a devious track. The one who took the least time and balanced the ball on the bot was the winner of the competition. The event saw a participation of 50 students, even the non-fanatics of robotics joining in to learn something new. 
<br/><br/>A photowalk was organised by the Digital Arts Society (DAS) of BVCOE. The aim of this event was to make the freshers aware of a photography technique called Levitation and make them acquainted with the basic rules of how it is implemented. Levitation is the rising of human body into the air by mystical means. More than 70 photography enthusiasts participated in the event and the organizers garnered a positive feedback from the participants. 
<br/><br/>A toy-collection drive, an initiative introduced by BVPIEEE in August 2014, was also taken up at IEEE Day. The proceeds of the drive will go to Akshay Pratishthan, an NGO, and it is a small way for the students to give back to the society. 
<br/><br/>Team BVPIEEE also organized a Hand printing activity. Students gathered in enthusiasm to participate in this convivial celebration, stamping their handprints with their favourite colours as the IEEE Day cheer spread across the college.

						<h2>DRISHTI MEET 1.0<span></span></h2>
						<p><br/>
						Drishti, the Photography and Videography SIG of BVPIEEE conducted its first meet of the session on 10TH October. It was conducted by Arjun Kumar, the Creativity Head of BVPIEEE. Details go as follows: 
<br/><br/>
Topic: LIGHT PAINTING AND PANORAMAS <br/>
Things Taught:<br/>
1.	Panoramas<br/>
2.	Light painting<br/>
<br/>
Light painting is a photographic technique in which exposures are made by moving a hand-held light source or by moving the camera. The term light painting also encompasses images lit from outside the frame with hand-held light sources. This technique was carried out by students using their smartphones. All students downloaded apps in their phones which helped them to control their shutter speed. After this, a source of light (here a torch) was moved around by them and they were able to trace the path of light.
<br/><br/>Panoramic photography is a technique of photography, using specialized equipment or software that captures images with elongated fields of view. It is sometimes known as wide format photography. During the Drishti panoramas weren’t taught by using a app in the student’s smart phones. The technique used was to take a series of shots by moving our camera about a horizontal straight line. Then these pics were merged into Photoshop giving a perfect panoramic shot.
<br/><br/>Turnout: Over 25 students turned up for the workshop. All of them were people having a passion for photography who loved taking pics from their smartphones.

						<h2>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Rotating Shield Quiz 2015<span></span></h2>
						<p>
						 
<br/>
BVPIEEE, the IEEE student branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College Of Engineering conducted the 8th edition of Vikram Sarabhai Rotating Shield Quiz inter-college quiz competition on 4th February, 2015 in the college auditorium.
<br/><br/>The quiz is one of the premier events of our student branch. This year too, the event saw a stupendous success. Statistics bear out the enormous response that was received as more than 150 ardent teams participated – most of them comprising of two members each, barring some lone wolves who battled like a one-man army. Prizes up to Rs. 10,000 were up for grabs. 
<br/><br/>The event kicked off with an inaugural ceremony initiated by our Honorable Principal, Prof. Dharmender Saini and, Branch counselor, Mr. Rahul Bahl. The quizmasters for the quizzing extravaganza were Karthikeya Ramesh, Subhav Duggal and Aryaman Nath. The quiz had three rounds. The teams gave a stiff competition to each other. Out of the 150 participating teams, 30 qualified. From the top 30, the top 6 teams were selected. And after a tough battle of brains, the top 3 position holders were announced. The top three teams that made it to the podium after dodging the questions were:
<br/>
1.	Shashank Singh and Shashwat Nagar from NSIT<br/>
2.	Mohd. Fahad and Lavanya Singh from DTU<br/>
3.	Aditya and Shivendra from DTU<br/><br/>
The NSIT Collegiates walked away with the top spot. Meanwhile DTU students ruled the roost, grabbing two out of top three positions. In addition to the cash prizes, the winners were also awarded certificates of honour. The winners of the First prize were also awarded a shield. Finally, the event was brought to a conclusion by Mr. Rahul Bahl’s golden words.
<br/><br/>
Sagacious and astute answers kept the spirit of competition alive. All in all, it was an engrossing and stimulating event that lived up to its billing as one of Delhi's top inter-college quizzes. The success of the event left the avid quizzers to earnestly wait for the next edition.

						<h2>Taking Sneezes <span>Nothing is out there&mdash;let's try again</span></h2>
						<p>I am living Egypt, living.... Your pyramids and your mosques and your old Nile can talk to me of things long past and gone, and I shall listen with interest to what they have to say, but I would rather be a living dog of an Egyptian than the dead lion of an Egyptian king—I would rather be a moving, talking native dressed in garish clothes than a Prince of the House of Rameses, sans eyes, sans ears, sans tongue, in the shrivelled brown form of a mummy.</p>
						<p>For there is something about these living ones that brings the dead to life. Sometimes when I look into their eyes I seem to see a strange, mysterious light in them—a light that never was on sea or land. It is then that I think of the things these people have seen in the forty centuries of which Napoleon spoke. I don't believe in magic, but I have seen strange things—things that make me remember that the magicians of Pharaoh were able to turn their rods into serpents!</p>
						<p>There came one day a very wise Egyptian—one whom I know as a Freemason—and he gave a valuable scarab, mounted in a gold ring, to Major Lynch. There was no doubt that the wise man valued it, and there is no doubt that he left an impression on Major Lynch. It is a talisman and a protection to the owner, but it has deadly powers. Nothing can harm the owner so long as he has it in his possession, and the owner can shrivel up an enemy by merely pointing at him and muttering incantations—just as the Northern Territory natives in Australia can will an enemy to die by pointing a bone at him. Major Lynch lost no time in putting the scarab to the test. There was a very troublesome native who used to bother him several times a day about things that don't matter, and the day after the wise Egyptian had made his presentation the major pointed at the native and muttered a powerful Australian incantation. Since then the native has not been seen.</p>

						<h2>Heavy Talks <span>Heated conversations in the back yard</span></h2>
						<p>One could not help contrasting this large force from Australia and New Zealand—a force that was to be doubled and trebled ere long—with the little force of 500 men which William Bede Dalley, Australian Orator and Patriot, sent from New South Wales to the Sudan just thirty years before. It spoke not only of the wonderful growth in population of Britain's Dominions of the South, but it was a living proof that the years had only served to cement the bonds of love and loyalty that bind the grand old Mother land to her Oversea Dominions. The rising in India, the intention of the Australians to proclaim their independence the moment when Britain found herself in peril—where were they? Where now was the "disintegration" of the British Empire which the German Emperor and his War Lords had so confidently predicted?</p>
						<p>With Cairo and the Nile safe, General Wilson was able to deal effectively with the invaders. Towards the latter end of January, Northern Sinai was overrun with them. From a couple of captured Shawishes of the 75th Turkish Regiment I learned that the staff arrangements by the German officers were excellent. Everything had been foreseen and provided for—or nearly everything. Water was available at each stage of the journey across the desert. Many boats and pontoons were dragged by oxen and camels along the caravan route from Kosseima, El Arish, and Nekl. A few six-inch guns were also transported to the Canal. To supplement the Turkish force on its south-westerly march all the pilgrims and Bedouins met with were pressed into service and rifles were given to them.</p>
						<p>It was on the morning of January 28 that the initial conflict took place at Kantara. A reconnoitring party from Bir El Dueidar attacked the British outposts but was repulsed, our losses being only one officer and one soldier killed and five Gurkhas wounded. Further south, near Suez, a nocturnal demonstration by the Turks merely served to prove the alertness of the defenders, though unfortunately two of our air scouts met with disaster. Their aeroplane came down outside our lines, and on returning on foot they were both shot dead by our own Indian patrols. The pity of it.</p>

						<h2>Mountain Sun <span>Crazy nature and other weather ideas</span></h2>
						<p>You had heard of the Plagues of Egypt; we have seen them, and are able to vouch for the authenticity of the Scriptures. Instead of hot cross buns, Easter brought us a plague of locusts. The entertainment started at about three o'clock in the afternoon and lasted till after sundown. Millions and billions and quadrillions of locusts danced and sang for us. The air was absolutely full of them, darkening the sun—big yellow and brown and black things, mostly about two inches long. They sounded like thousands of whirring wheels, and they dropped on the roofs with a noise like rain. Where they landed they left everything bare as a bone. All along the Nile the "gyppies" turned out and banged tin cans to drive them off. Here was an invasion, if you like! The telegraph wires were black with them—like long beads. Some of the beautiful Ma'adi gardens were quite spoilt. These locusts of Egypt have absolutely no love for the beautiful—in fact, the more beautiful a thing is the more delight do they take in devouring it.</p>
						<p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for ever—and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful! Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader, do not waste your sympathies on us. It was tiresome work, marching, training—training for the front, which for months never seemed to get any nearer, and some of "the boys"—those of them who were "spoiling for a fight," as the saying is—used at times to kick over the traces and paint the town vermilion; but there are compensations in Egypt for all who would seek them. What did it matter that we had no hot cross buns for Easter, no hard-boiled eggs, no ling, no salmon? We had omelettes and quail on toast, and chicken and curry and strawberries (no cream) and oranges and custard and jelly and Turkish coffee and Nile fish and pancakes and fritters and iced butter and beautiful jam and marmalade—and cigars. So we managed to get "a snack," you see. And I know that I, for one, had no desire just then to swap places with any man in Australia.</p>

						<p>It was night when we got back to camp. Oh, those Egyptian nights! The winter cold has gone, and spring is in the air. The nights are fine and fair, clear and cloudless, with the moon pure silver. The reflections in the Nile are just wonderful. The huge date palms stand out sharply from a star-spangled sky that somehow has a tint of green in its blue. One thinks of the Arabian Nights. The very street scenes make one think of them. Motors glide up and down the streets with rich Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Italians, Frenchmen and Englishmen, going to the Continental, or to Shepheard's, or to private entertainments. It is a gorgeous splash of colour. They had no motor-cars that I remember in those old Arabian Nights, but the magic of the thing and the colour of it all were surely much the same. And the roads of Egypt—how beautiful they are!—clean and smooth as a billiard table. Are there any finer roads in the whole world than the Mena road and that to Heliopolis? Fifty miles an hour is easy. I sometimes shudder now when I recall the races that we used to have along those roads at night, crying "Egre! Egre!"—Faster! Faster!</p>

						<h2>Beloved Mother <span>Decomposing fruits and burning houses</span></h2>
						<p>One night stands out—a gorgeous night—a carnival in honour and aid of brave little Serbia. Kipling says that "East is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet"; but he surely has not seen a Venetian carnival in Cairo, with its intermingling of the progressive Occident and the picturesque Orient. One will always remember that. When the tourists from the West overrun the land of the Pharaohs, as they do once a year, a Venetian fête is held at Shepheard's—the social event of the season. Sightseers from England, idle rich from the Continent, plutocrats from America, tourists from the four quarters of the world, all meet and make merry here. This year of grace witnessed a somewhat different spectacle, it is true. It was a polyglot gathering of all nations, to be sure, but the tourist element was wanting. In the place of the tourists, however, was the "Army of Occupation." Hundreds of officers, British, French, Egyptian, Australian and New Zealand, in smart uniforms, gave striking colour to the scene, which was made additionally picturesque by the vari-coloured silks and satins, scarfs and veils of the ladies. The garden was a blaze of splendour. There were the flags of the nations, there were flowers and palms and purling fountains, mirth and music, lights and laughter, and over all—confetti. All night the air was thick with confetti, like snow falling off a rainbow. Revellers flew hither and thither, flinging it everywhere. Merry maidens threw handfuls of confetti and eyesful of bold glances at the sun-tanned colonials. There was no respite until the ground was ankle-deep with confetti.</p>
						<p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for ever—and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful! Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader, do not waste your sympathies on us.

						<p>One charge was led by a doctor; another by a priest. Several times they charged so fiercely that they looked like getting out of hand. Scorning cover, they also scorned rifle fire. They scaled the steel-lined heights like demons. It was the bayonet all the time. One huge farmer actually bayoneted a Turk through the chest and pitchforked him over his shoulder. The man who performed this feat was a huge Queenslander—Sergeant Burne, of the 9th Battalion, who was afterwards wounded and returned to his Australian home—a man whose modesty is as great as his size. We smiled at first when we heard the story, and people in England and Australia read of it with amazement. But Sergeant Burne, standing over six feet high, and massively proportioned, looks quite capable of the feat. He himself tells the story in these words: "It is not a case for me to take any credit at all," he said. "I was in the platoon that landed first on the right. Our lieutenant was the first man to get ashore—and as game a man as ever faced fire. I followed him. I was ordered to take in hand a line of Turkish sharpshooters who were causing a lot of trouble. There was also a machine-gun on the hill. Somebody had to stop it. Myself and two lads went up, and we stopped it. That's all. There were ten Turks there. We got the Turks and we got the machine-gun, but I lost my two lads. They were only boys, but let me tell you the Australians are the best fighters in the world. One of the lads 'fixed' the German officer who was working the machine-gun. The Turks were higher up than we were, and I suppose that is how I was able to throw one of them over my shoulder. It's an old trick that is taught in the Guards."</p>

						<h2>Happiness <span>On self-sufficient homes and pets</span></h2>
						<p>The casualties among the officers were tremendous—brave men who led Australia's soldiers in that awful charge! And among the bravest of them were the young officers from the Duntroon Military College that stands amid delightful country surroundings near the capital of Federated Australia that is now in the making in the Mother State of New South Wales. These young fellows fought in a way that showed their native courage and the excellence of their training. Only the year before, when Sir Ian Hamilton, as Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces, visited Australia and inspected these lads who were training for the army at Duntroon, as the representative of the Sydney Morning Herald I remember seeing them laugh and cheer when Sir Ian Hamilton, on leaving Duntroon, jokingly wished them "plenty of wars and rapid promotion." And it seems only a few days since we were dancing and flirting in a Cairo ballroom. Now many of them lie sorely wounded at the base hospital, and several will never again hear the réveillé. But the College will not forget its firstfruits offered up so gladly for empire. Officers and men, it was all the same—they went to their death with a cheer for King and Country. I heard an Imperial officer, newly returned from Flanders, say that the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade was the finest brigade of infantry in the whole of the allied armies. In physique they were far superior to any of the British, French, or Belgian troops. Whether this be true or not, there is no doubt that the sturdy Thirds under Colonel Maclagan fought like Trojans on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and covered themselves with glory. Incidentally, I might mention, some of them never fired a shot during the fierce fighting of April 25. They simply trusted to the cold steel, and flung themselves at the Turkish trenches. The 1st Brigade (Colonel MacLaurin), the 2nd (Colonel McCay), and the rest of the Australians and New Zealanders fought with equal valour, but the brunt of the attack was borne by the Thirds. So many hundred gallant lives was a heavy price to pay for a footing in Gallipoli, but those impetuous charges, absolutely irresistible in their fury, would, we knew, bear rich fruit, for the Turks could never again withstand a bayonet charge by the Australians.</p>
						<p>To have gone through all they had gone through, and then to treat it all so lightly, seemed an extraordinary thing. All the doctors and nurses commented on the amazing fortitude and cheerfulness of the Australian wounded. I used to think the desire to be in the thick of things, that I had so often heard expressed, was make-believe, but I know better now. I used to say myself that I "wanted to be there" (and sotto voce I used to add "I don't think"); and now, in my heart-searchings, I began to wonder if I didn't really mean it, after all. I used to strike an attitude and quote, "One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name," whilst all the time I felt in my heart that I would prefer a crowded age of glorious life to an hour of fame. Now I began to wonder whether in my heart's core, in my very heart of hearts, I did not agree with the poet. The proper study of mankind is Oneself. And what was I doing there, anyway?</p>
						<p>And now, a hundred years after, we see French and British warships again off Alexandria. But this time the Union Jack and the Tricolour are intertwined, and in the streets of Alexandria French and British soldiers and sailors walk arm in arm, while the ancient city is gay with flags and bunting. For big things are brewing in the Levant. Before the eyes of the citizens during the past week was a unique international naval and military pageant—Zouaves, with their blue jackets and red trousers, French infantry in their blue-grey uniform, cavalry with gay tunics, British Jack Tars in blue and white, Australians in sombre khaki, swarthy-skinned Maoris from the Wonderland of the Southern Seas, and dusky warriors from the Punjab. British troops—and especially those young giants from Australia—had the better of the Frenchman in the matter of physique; but there was clear evidence of "grit" in the intelligent, humorous faces of the French, which helped one to understand why, for instance, they are said to be the finest marchers in Europe, and why the Germans never got to Paris!</p>
