						<h2>Cyber Security and Privacy<span>Harsh Suryavanshi, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</span></h2>
						<p>Cyber Security is a major concern for today’s cyber world. When you are online, it is almost impossible to trust anyone. Whether you are a Developer, a normal user or running a business online, you become the target of cyber criminals, covert government agencies and many other spying programs. The NSA Prism spying program is a good example where National Security Agency, USA was found spying on its own citizens, companies and many other people around the world, using various monitoring techniques and phone tapping methods. Seizing of many TOR Darknet websites in Europe is another example where anybody can imagine what level of anonymity he has.						</p>
						<p>Some of recent examples of Cyber-attacks and data breaches are 7 million Gmail password leaks, Dropbox password leaks, ITunes Hack, Sony media hack and Hijacking of Google Indonesia Domain. There are a number of attacks that are taking place even as you’re reading this article. New bugs, zero day Vulnerabilities and zero day exploits are being found every day, examples of some such serious vulnerabilities are Shellshock, DHCPShock and Heartbleed.</p>
						<p>If we talk about a normal user, he is being tracked by many tech giants like Facebook, Google with cookies and sessions. A hacker in some corner of the world may have turned your system into a zombie without your knowledge through his bots, malwares and rootkits, bypassing firewalls and antivirus protections.  </p>
						<p>Now where is the problem? What can we do? We do a lot of bank transactions, shopping with the same system, so what about our secrets and privacy? The best thing one can do is being aware about the threats, using updated software and VPNs with no logs for anonymity to create awareness among people and serious users. There are many Human Right Activists who are fighting for justice in the cyber world after NSA program. The OWASP (OPEN WEB APPLICATION SECURITY PROJECT) have been helping developers and pen testers by releasing many security Guidelines and resources for years. All hackers are not evil, instead they are the immunity system of the Internet which help us find loopholes and thereby changing our methodologies, forcing us to adopt new technology. Being aware about all such threats even the Indian Government also launched CERT-INDIA (Computer Emergency Response Team – INDIA) and NSD (National Security Database). So there are challenges and threats in cyber world but there is also hope and people to tackle those challenges.</p>

						<h2>MP3 format
						 <span>Tushar Mudgal , Bharati Vidyapeeth College of  Engineering</span></h2>
							<p>MP3 format is an audio compression tool that reduces the size of audio file without affecting the quality of sound. Today, thousands of mp3 files are shared across the world. With this format a 20 megabyte song is compressed into about 2 megabyte. It not only allows a fast access to a file but it also saves a lot of storage space. It has changed the traditional ways which people used to listen and store music.</p>
							<p>Well coming to the facts, do you know that the data stored on a CD in straight line is about 4 miles long. Surprised!</p>
							<p>Ok let’s do some arithmetic calculations to understand.</p>
							<p>Music in CD’s is sampled at 44,000 times per second (44 kHz). The samples are 2 bytes (16 bits) long. So total sampling bits would be equal to 44 kHz * 16 bits which equal 704 Kbits /sec. Also separate samples are taken for left and right speakers so the total sampling bits would be 704 Kbits /sec * 2 equals roughly 1.4 million bits per second.</p>
							<p>Now, an average song is about 3 minutes long i.e. 180 seconds, then the average song on a CD consumes about 32 million bytes (or 32 megabytes) of space. This data is uncompressed with high resolution. When this data is stored in desktops or mobile storage, it occupies a large amount of data. In other situation if we want to download this data it can takes several minutes to download over the internet, even with high speed cable or DSL Modem.</p>
							<p>The solution to this kind of problem was MP3 which will compress the data without affecting the quality of sound.</p>
							<p>But the question is how to compress the file without hurting the quality of audio file?</p>
							<p>As we all use .jpg and .gif files that compresses the images or the zip files that compress text all the time. The same concept is used in audio compression. Both these methods make use of compression algorithms.</p>
							<p>Compression algorithm- is a technique used in computer science that encodes information using fewer bits than the original representation. It is just like a telegram where unnecessary words are removed without losing the meaning of the message. </p>
							<p>Similarly, the compression algorithms are developed for audio that removes the certain parts of the audio without hurting the quality of music. To make a good compression algorithm for sound, a technique called perceptual noise shaping is used. It's "perceptual" partly because the MP3 format uses characteristics of the human ear to design the compression algorithm.</p>
							<p>Perceptual Noise shaping- Perceptual noise shaping is a technique used to develop compression algorithms that converts audio files to MP3 files. The figure below presents three different scenarios with prospect to our human ear.</p>

						<h2>Why You Will Never Drive a Car Again<span>Ashna Goel, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</span></h2>
						<p>The Dream of having Driverless Cars may soon become a reality.</p>
<p>The fantasy of driverless cars has been with us for ages. Movies have had them, sci-fi books have described them and various companies have given it a go. It’s only now that new experiments have shown that this dream concept may soon be a reality. As always, new technology throws up equal parts of delight and despair. That’s why driverless cars may well be the greatest boon and bane of recent times.</p>
<p>The Google Driverless cars is a project by Google that involves developing technology for autonomous cars. The project is currently being led by Google Engineer, Sebastian Thrun, former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and co-inventor of Google Street View. Google presented a new prototype of their driverless car that had neither steering wheel nor pedals.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with techniques such as radar, LIDAR (Light Radar System), GPS, and computer vision. This laser allows the vehicle to generate a detailed 3D map of its environment. The car then takes these generated maps and combines them with high-resolution maps of the world. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. This helps in producing different types of data models that allow the car to drive itself.</p>
<br/><br/>Google Founders Sergey Brian and Larry page came out with some thoughts on how a Driverless car would actually be used. Nobody would own these cars, just page one to pick you up wherever you were and drop you at your destination. No finding for car parking, no waste of parking space, no fighting with neighbors over wrongfully parked cars. This could revolutionize the urban planning.
<br/><br/>Cars for all: Many people like children, the aged the differently abled cannot drive. Also those who cannot wrap their heads around negotiating a car and unruly traffic face terrible problems dealing with simplest commutes. Driverless cars are for all and takes care of the problem of wasted time and space.
<br/><br/>Radical Form Factor: No steering wheel, no pedal, and no seat for a driver, everyone in the car is a passenger, more space, better ergonomics. A driverless car is a total reboot of the design and process of what a car is and how it is built. From seating to engine to safety standards, everything will be more efficient and usable.

						<h2>MONEYPAD - THE FUTURE WALLET<span>Srishti Sharma, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</span></h2>
						<p>
						The 21st century will not be cashless, as many people predict today. However, it does seem clear that the currency of 21st century will be “paperless”. Just as everything is getting under the shadow of “e”. Today we have paper currency being replaced by electronic money or e-cash in the form of MoneyPads. 
<br/><br/>The use of technology in commercial activities for many years has led to the emergence of various new supporting services in the marketplace. Among these services is the e-payment which enables payment done via the electronic medium and without involving any physical cash. Paper currency and checks are gradually substituted by smart cards, digital cash, and instant transfer of funds. 
<br/><br/>The wallet of the future will hold less paper cash, coins and magnetic stripe cards. It will hold instead MoneyPad containing digital cash and other financial information.
<br/><br/>The money pad here uses the biometrics technology for finger print recognition. MoneyPad is the form of credit card or smart card. It consists of a touch sensor and magnetic disk as its peripherals. Touch sensor is used to record the fingerprint of the user. Magnetic disk, which has the read and write permission is used to hold the authentication details of the user, bank code as well as digital-cash. The bank code and account number of the owner of this money pad is present on the label. Every time the user wants to access the moneypad he has to make an impression of his fingers which will be scanned and matched with one in the hard disk of the data base server. If the finger print matches with the user’s he will be allowed the access and use the Pad otherwise the money pad is not accessible.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>Although credit cards provide us with e-cash but it offers some disadvantages. In credit cards user is always under the pressure of limits on purchase defined by the issuer of the card and
also every transaction involves certain charges. Credit card uses fixed encryption hence, the transactions are insecure. Also the card has to be renewed once it is expired.
<br/><br/>For a digital currency system to attain widespread recognition and use, the following three requirements are necessary. These are: instant clearing of funds, elimination of payment risk and secure transactions using strong encryption. MoneyPad fulfills all such requirements and offers many advantages. It reduces fraud by employing hard to forge technologies and materials. It eliminates the problems caused by loss of IDs or forgotten passwords by using physiological attributes. It also makes it possible to know WHO did WHAT, WHERE and WHEN.
<br/><br/>Money platform uses the most secure encryption and decryption methods for online transactions money platform allows the instant release of funds, and it acts as a digital cash. This avoids the inconvenience of extension, and can be used in Trade and implement remote transactions in a simpler way.
<br/><br/>
In the future when we will have the ‘Internet Of Things’ there would be a decreasing requirement of any cards or pads just small devices which would be able to identify finger prints and could be found all over the world.

						<h2>Revolutionizing your viewpoint: Google Glass<span>Mahesh Mehandiratta, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering </span></h2>
						<p>Just when we started to believe that we had the latest of tech in our pockets, Google is back again to prove us wrong. With the launch of the revolutionary google glasses, google has raised the bar for advanced technologies in the whole world. Though worn just like ordinary glasses, they provide a whole lot of extraordinary features that no one could ever imagine to be incorporated in a simple pair of spectacles. From a simple speaker to voice control, from 4g access to a multi functioning camera, from capability to send a simple text message to google maps and google translate. You name it, and google glasses have it. It feels no less than a whole smart phone right in front of your eye (yes, of course, in a much reduced size). The screen being just a tiny 0.5 inch display, uses prism technology to project the screen at our retina so that it appears to be a 25 inch screen placed at a distance of 2.4m. Amazing, isn't it? To utilize the power of this display, we have the augmented reality of google glasses. The glasses to enhance the overall user experience, display the collaboration of the real world image with a virtual image created by it, hence, assuring that you have the best of both worlds.
<br/><br/>
Though, otherwise completely voice controlled: with commands like "Ok glass”, "Ok glass, capture a pic", they also have a physical button and physical tap controls for functions like going to home screen, attending calls etc. You are always just a command away from clicking and recording HD photos and videos with its inbuilt camera. To add to it, google glasses also support ambient intelligence i.e. the device can adjust itself according to you and the environment around you so that you have the smoothest of experience with them. Currently, the glasses are already available to public for 1000$ in US and UK and have been a huge success for the grand brand google. But can their awesomeness enthrall the whole world? Well, that, only time will tell.

						<h2>The Science in Indian Mythology<span>Karun M, SRM University NCR Campus</span></h2>
						<p>
						
In an era like this, where people race against time and where technological advancements have reached beyond an average human imagination; why not set things apart and think about the time before any science and technology was brought to notice. In this article I have elucidated some unbelievable correlation between Hindu mythological stories and well established scientific facts. 
<br/><br/>A few excerpts from the Mahabharata have caused doubts in the minds of historians, indicating the possibility of nuclear weapons being used in the Mahabharata war or post-war. This fire of suspicion has further been fuelled by the recent discoveries of green glass and many radioactive samples in certain excavations, in India, which apparently were associated with the Mahabharata war. Green glass is said to form when sand melts at very high temperatures prevalent in Nuclear Explosions 
<br/><br/>The science of cloning was well known and practised during the Mahabharata times. As per Dr. B.G. Matapurkar, the Kauravas "were products of technology that modern science has not even developed yet". He said that according to the description in Mahabharata, the Kauravas were created by splitting the single embryo into 100 parts and growing each part in a separate container. In other words, "they not only knew about test-tube babies and embryo splitting but also had the technology to grow human foetuses outside human body."
<br/><br/>In Mahabharata, when Subhadra was pregnant, Arjun told her the secret of entering the Chakravyuh. When he was explaining the exit procedure, Subhadra fell asleep. Hence Abhimanyu learned the entrance procedure while he was in Subhadra's womb but did not learn the exit strategy. There was a time when people criticized this concept. But modern science says that it is very much possible. In his book "Right Brain Education in Infancy" Dr. Makoto Shichida, says, the right brain is active during gestation.
<br/><br/>Ramasethu (the Lanka Bridge in Ramayana) is an engineering masterpiece. From scientific point of view, the technology once existed to make stones float on water and the architect like Nal and Neel were two architects advanced in building a bridge from India to Sri Lanka within 5 days with the help of dedicated work force of million Vanaras. Even in Valmiki Ramayana, there is a concept of civil engineering in building this bridge. This bridge was not constructed just by throwing stone with lord name but there were many engineering methods.
<br/><br/>Two lines of “Hanuman Chalisa" computes the distance of earth from sun with great simplicity and that too quite accurately - जुग सहस्त्र योजन पर भानु, लील्यो ताहि मधुर फल जानू (Juug Sahastra Yojan Par Bhanu, Lilyo taahi madhur fal jaanun). This means that Sun (Bhanu) is at a distance of Juug Sahastra Yojans (जुग सहस्त्र योजन- Distance Unit in Hindi). According to conversion practices that are in use as per Hindu Vedic Literature - 1Juug= 12000; Sahastra= 1000; 1Yojan=8 Miles. Thus 12000 X 1000 X 8 = 96,000,000 miles. 1 mile= 1.6 km. This means 153,600,000 Km. In the 17th century two scientists Giovanni and Richer have calculated the distance of sun from earth accurately and real close (at 140 million kilometres) to now officially declared figures.
<br/><br/>If we look into ancient texts we can find a number of references to time travelling. In Hindu mythology, there is the story of King Raivata Kakudmi who travels to meet the creator Brahma. Even if this trip didn’t last long, when Kakudmi returned back to Earth, 108 Yugas had passed on Earth, and it is thought that each Yuga represents about 4 million years. The explanation Brahma gave to Kakudmi is that time runs differently in different planes of existence.
<br/><br/>Such are the unbelievable evidences of ancient times that clearly correlate to the present day sciences. There may still be many more evidences. Are these evidences just a coincidence or really a matter of consideration it’s something for the readers to ponder on.

						<h2>How to NOT sound silly to nerds: Guide to correct pronunciations!<span>Dharvi Verma, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</span></h2>
						<p>
						“Hey, that’s not how you pronounce meme!”
<br/><br/>
You might have heard that from one of your friends. Nerds hate it when you get the technical terms wrong. You might want to be careful the next time you talk of a GIF or talk about how much you value Aereo (pronounced as Air-eh-oh), the TV streaming service that has divided opinions all over the world.
<br/><br/>
So, here we go:
1. GIF
 
While you may be an expert at creating GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format), you may be pronouncing it with a ‘G’ while it is actually pronounced with a ‘J’. While the Oxford American Dictionary accepts both GIF and JIF, Steve Wilhite, the creator, clarified that it is actually JIF (that peanut butter, yep) while accepting an award in 2013.
<br/><br/>2. Meme
This may be the thing which gives you your daily dose of laughter- surfing internet memes (9gag rings a bell, eh?). But chances are that you may, just may, be calling it ‘mem’ or ‘me-me’ while it is actually pronounced as ‘meem’. So, the next time you stare at a Ryan Gosling meme, make sure you don’t mispronounce it.
3. Cache
You may know all about this form of memory which stores data transparently for fast delivery in case of future requests. Just a titbit you need to know: it is pronounced as ‘cash’ and not ‘cashae’ or ‘cach’. 
<br/><br/>
4. Adobe
Everyone’s favourite pfd file viewer, Photoshop software, Illustrator etc (you name it!), the multimedia giant Adobe is pronounced at ‘Uh-Doe-Bee’ and not ‘a-do-b’ or ‘a-doh-b’. 
<br/><br/>
5. OS X
Chances are that you are probably saying ‘oh-ess-ex’ when you talk about the operating system. Sorry folks, but it is pronounced as ‘oh-ess-ten’. X denotes the Roman numeral for the digit 10 here and not the alphabet X.

						<h2>Please connect your charger.<span>Divyanshu Sharma, Bhatai Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</span></h2>
						<p>
						“Kisi ke paas battery bank hai?” is something you might recall hearing 5 times a day as a part of your college routine. The cause, as you might also recall, is the 5 inch 2ish GHz bundle of joy inside your pockets. The smartphone revolution has taken the world by storm, and mobile computing technology is booming at an exponential rate. But as ppi values and cat videos galore, the average up time of a phone today has dropped to a day of moderate usage, from a time where a single charge could last weeks.
<br/><br/>This scenario points towards the obvious fact that battery technology, the trusted Lithium-ion based cells, hasn’t been able to keep up with the ever increasing power demands of portable devices. Battery tech is becoming the limiting factor in many of today’s technologies.
<br/><br/>According to a survey of more than 1,000 adults, only 2 percent said they were extremely or very likely to buy Internet-connected glasses, such as Google Glass, in 2015, and 4K television didn't do much better. Seventy-five percent of respondents said they had never heard of it. Meanwhile, consumers indicated that the new smartphone feature they were most excited about — picked by 33 percent of respondents — was "improved battery life."
<br/><br/>But even though batteries haven’t seen much love over the past years, there are a bunch of new technologies on the horizon to increase the charge storage, reduce the charging time, and to make that little red battery a lesser annoyance.


<br/><br/>


StoreDot

 <br/>
StoreDot gained plenty of attention when it released details about its clever, and very fast, charging system recently. How fast? A Galaxy S4 can go from zero percent to capacity in just 30 seconds, when powered by this impressive tech.
In an attempt to cure Alzheimer disease, Professor Ehud Gazit discovered Peptides (amino acids) that have special qualities - optic and electric, and StoreDot was born.
<br/><br/>
StoreDot focus on bio-organic nano-crystal technology as an enabler for faster charging batteries and also a cheaper and non-toxic alternative to cadmium in screens.
Titanium dioxide nanotubes
 <br/><br/>
Specifically, the NTU researchers claim this new battery technology has a whopping 10,000-cycle lifespan, meaning you can charge a battery 10,000 times before its max charge starts to reduce.
Enabling the nifty new tricks doesn’t require a full reimagining of how we design batteries, either. The researchers replaced the graphite used in the anode of lithium-ion batteries with a gel made from titanium dioxide nanotubes, a thousand times thinner than the diameter of a human hair.
Using tiny titanium dioxide nanotubes rather than graphite also speeds how quickly electrons and ions flow in and out of the battery, by ditching an energy-slowing additive needed in today’s batteries. The NTU researchers say their battery charges far faster than traditional lithium-ion batteries, going from empty to a 70 percent charge in just two minutes.
<br/><br/>Trontium Reactor

 <br/><br/>
USB Power Delivery is a new standard through which devices with USB ports can ask for an additional power over the standard supplied by USB 3.0. Devices can request up to 20 volts and 5 Amps, resulting in a maximum of 100 watts.
<br/><br/>
The Reactor has a monster 290 watt-hour battery inside, and three 100 watt-capable USB ports on the top. It doesn’t only charge phones either, it’ll sort out your 13-inch Macbook Air 5 times, or a Surface Pro 2 6 times. With the addition of a special splitter cable, the Reactor can recharge up to 18 phones at the same time from a single USB port.
<br/><br/>
Super capacitors
 <br/><br/>

Super capacitors are batteries that fit somewhere in-between regular batteries and rechargeable cells. They can be charged very quickly, store plenty of energy, then send it out over a sensible amount of time. Despite this fast-paced, hard-living lifestyle, the cells aren’t fragile, and can see tens of thousands of charge cycles before they give up.
<br/><br/>
Quick Charge 2.0
 <br/><br/>
Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0 technology doesn’t extended the life of your battery, but it can make charging one a faster process. Built into its Snapdragon processors, and into specially made wall chargers, Quick Charge 2.0 promises to charge a smartphone battery 75 percent quicker than before. For example, a 3300mAh cell should take just 96 minutes to fully charge, compared to 270 minutes using a conventional charger. The downside is, both your phone and the charger need to have Quick Charge technology as standard, and there’s no backwards compatibility either. 
<br/><br/>
20 second charge
 <br/><br/>
One exciting talent to keep an eye on is Eesha Khare, a Harvard student of Indian origin, who developed an award-winning battery. Her tiny invention can store an impressive amount of energy despite its miniature size, a key factor that could revolutionize smartphone battery technology.
Eesha's 'super capacitor energy storage device' is made of carbon fiber and metal oxides, and the clever nanotech not only charges mobile devices at a faster rate than previously possible, it also holds charge for much longer.
<br/><br/>
Even though technologies like these instill a sense of optimism in our mind, the actual viability is bleak to say the least. So till then, “Battery bank die!”
