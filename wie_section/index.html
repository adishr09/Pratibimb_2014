						<h2>Life In The Metro <span></span></h2>
						<p>In the vast sea of people travelling through the lifeline of delhi i.e. the delhi metro, the ladies coach however, segregated from the others seems to have the most buzz. Well, the reason is pretty obvious - LADIES ! The female homo sapiens seem to be overly enthusiastic about their and everyone else's looks. So much so that gossip has become a word synonymous to all the girls in the world. 
					There isn't any weird fact about women that has remained unsaid so we won't delve into that "rocket science-y" realm. This article is about how personalities in the metro can be judged through just nine simple characteristics. </p>

					<p>#1 The I want that seat girl
					When all the seats are occupied(sometimes more than occupied) and you can't see a peck of space someone just comes in and says "please adjust :) " ...  what adjust ? I know we're Indians and adjustment is all we know but this! These kind of people are haughty , loud mouthed and totally self obsessed. They have this invisible crown and a tattoo on their head saying "I am my daddy's princess, I do not stand. "
					How to spot instantly : Loud , Loud , Loud. Both clothes and voice.</p>

					<p>#2 The Phoney Baloney girl
					"Haanji.. awaaz ni aari! Arrey.. metro me hu.. awaaz nhi ari.. "
					If there is a network problem then why don't u just put your phone down? Shouting incessantly and disturbing everyone else won't help you. These people are attention seekers. They just love to be the centre of everything , be it good or bad.
					How to spot instantly : phone glued to ears or earphones jammed into them.</p>

					<p>#3 The traffic jammers
					Yeah! Metro also has traffic jams. Even after repeatedly hearing."Do not sit on the floor of the train" people just don't get it. They just go and sit wherever feels nice and block everyone else's way. 
					How to spot instantly : Tired eyes. No hope of standing left, they'll either sit or fall. Give the damned woman a seat!</p>

					<p>#4 The gossip friends
					We LOVE to talk. About anything and everything. This is a universal fact. But every once in a while , the door opens and enters a group of friends who will be running a broadcast channel about "falani" Auntie's "dhimkana" beta . Sorry ! Not interested dude! 
					How to spot instantly : This one's easy. Keep your ears open :P</p>

					<p>#5 The crier
					Everyone is going through some problem or the other but public display of your emotions can never be justified. People just start crying in front of everyone and instead of consoling them , most people are either giving them looks or making the pity face. 
					How to spot instantly : Tears!</p>

					<p>#6 The girlfriend
					It's a common scenario to see couples standing at the interface between the two coaches , unabashed and unconcerned about everything else. It's actually the lover's point. So all the juliets meet their Romeos at the joint even though travelling in the general coach is always an option.
					How to spot instantly : public display of affection with the constant baby and jaanu!</p>

					<p>#7 The gundaa
					People are always in high airs about themselves and live in a bubble. These kind of people always have a manly walk and are hurting people as they pass by. They just shake their hands and legs unconcernedly even though they know about the immensity of the crowd.
					How to spot instantly : you can hear people say ooh! Ouch! As they walk by.</p>

						<h2>Prescriptive Morality
						 <span>K.V. Smitha, Hansraj College , DU</span></h2>
						<p>While  Pepsi  is  busy  belting  out  creative  taglines  which  never  fail  to  leave  a  smile  on  our  faces , the  leader  of  PepsiCo , its  parent  company  is  fighting  another  battle. ‘Oh  Yes  Abhi!’ , ‘Live  For  Now’, ‘More  Happy’ have  captured  the hearts  of  customers , and  encapsulate  the  essence  of  youth , vibrancy , perseverance , and  above  all ,  the  ‘Never  Say  Die’ spirit  promoting  equality  and  happiness. But  when  Indra  Nooyi,  CEO  of  PepsiCo,  famously  stated, “Women can’t  have  it  all.” It  was  one  of  those  moments, when  you  realize  that  the  utopian  version  of  equality  is  just  one  of  our  wild  fantasies.</p>
						<center><img src="img/2_1.jpg"></center>
						<p>Just  when  people  had  started  ditching  feminism  for  the  world  ‘seemed’  to  move towards  equality, Nooyi’s  comments  have  brought  the  entire  corporate  stage  to  a standstill.  Her  painful  acceptance  of  the  fact  that  women  just  can’t  have  it  all, even  though  “…we  might  pretend  to.” , brings  to  the  fore,  various  issues  like gender  discrimination,  which  slowly  were  being  pushed  to  the  backburner.  The mother-child  relationship  is  the  worst  affected, as  per  Nooyi, who  believes  that “...the  biological  clock  and  the  career  clock  are  in  total  conflict… ” for  a  woman. ‘There  is  only  so  much  you  can  do.’, has  been, most  unfortunately,  glorified. The sense  of  resignation,  though  depressing,  has  been  echoed  by  many  women executives  like  Andrea  Thomas, CEO  of  ScratchMeNot,  Jen  Lee  Kos  of BRIKA.com,  and  Patricia  Campbell  of  LegalAdvice.com  among  others. The  cocktail  of  ambition  and  guilt  have,  since  ages,  been  portrayed  as  a  dangerous mix  for  women,  whose  sole  purpose  in  life  is  to  get  married  and  have  children (Pun , obviously , intended).  Choosing  between  building  a  career  and  being  a  full time  mother , is  more  of  a  battle  fought  in  the  mind. If  the  former  wins,  the woman  is  deemed  to  be  an  over  ambitious  bossy  bitch,  but  if  the  latter  wins (which  always  has  a  higher  probability), the  decision  is  deemed  as  ‘the  natural thing  to  do’.</p>
						<p>When  a  high  powered  woman  is  asked  to  ‘leave  her  crown’ at  the  garage,  and when  she  is  asked  to  fetch  milk  after  a  day’s  hard  work, it  pretty  much  sums  up  that  the  battle  is  already  lost. When  a  working  woman  is  bulldozed  with  snide remarks  about  her  parenting, it  is  almost  always  clear  that  she  had  it  coming.
					The  prescribed  code  laid  down  ages  ago,  says  that  women  aren’t  intended  to  do  what  the  men  do. Manusmriti,  a  holy  Hindu  text  from  the past, says  the following : Her  father  protects  her  in  childhood,  her  husband  protects  her  in  youth,  and  her  son  protects  her  in  old  age; a  woman  is  never  fit  for  independence.  Early  Christianity  deems  woman  as  ‘defective’  and  ‘misbegotten’. Several  scriptures  from  different  religions  have  stated  women  to  be  inferior  to men,  which  is  often  met  with  a  casual  shrug  by  men  even  today! The  immensity of  this  marginalization  of  women  is  unimaginable.  The  wall  is  so  thick ,  that  even  the  most  successful  women  finds  it  hard  to  believe  that  the  success  she has  attained  is  real. The 2003 Julia Roberts’ starrer ‘ Mona  Lisa  Smile’, subtly conveys  the  sorry  state  of  affairs  through  one  of  the  well  thought  dialogues , which  is  unfortunately  true:  A  good  wife  lets  her  husband  think  that  everything’s his  idea  even  when  it  is  not.
					So  basically  what  the  world  tell  us  is , “Don’t  you  worry! Everything  has  been written  down  for  you  to  follow.  Just  go  along  the  handbook.  But don’t  you  dare venture  outside  the  ‘prescribed’  book.  Just  play  the  role  for  which  you  were  born-  that  of  a  woman.  A  woman , who  is  not  allowed  to  think,  who  has  to accept  the  boundaries  as  set  by  the  men,  who  is  merely  the  dust  of  the  feet  of her  male  counterpart.”</p>
					<p>The  silver  lining  is  the  fact  that  ultimately,  what  is  normative,  is  almost  always JUNKED.
					The  question, therefore,  is  whether  we  agree  to  disagree?  The  economy  runs because  of  the  speculation  that  everything  goes  as  planned,  rockets  are  launched  because  the  scientists  are  sure  that  they  won’t  explode,  we  fall  in  love because  we  are  always  certain  of  ‘happily  ever  after’. Recessions  happen. Freak accidents  happen. Heartbreaks  happen.  Just  because  a  hugely  respected  leader says  the  truth, it  doesn’t  have  to  squash  our  hopes. It  doesn’t  have  to  be  a  battle  between  the  sexes. And  no,  it  doesn’t  have  to  be  an  agreement.  Nor  does it  have  to  be  feminism.  Stick  to  one’s  guns,  for  the  world  runs  on  hope. The  hope  for  a  free  world,  once  tagged  ‘utopian’,  materialized  after  centuries  of fighting  the  shackles  of  slavery.  Can  an  ‘equal  world’  be  far  behind?  I    believe not.

						<p>She jumped over the pole of the toll booth with a solitary halogen shining towards the ground, illuminating the area. The booth, fortunately had been defunct for about a year thereby making up for the dearth of a place to practice.</p>
						<p>One day her father promised to her as they dined to fulfill her wish to see cinema. A rare luxury, the remote town did not present many sources of amusement to the poor citizens of her village. She and her father chose to watch the 9 PM show of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.
						Engrossed, her eyes wouldn't budge from the screen. The ravishing graphics, the cloud of emotions and the undying spirit compelled her to absorb each frame and moment of the 3 hour long story. She was impressed and at the same time overwhelmed at the incredible presentation of the athlete's life. His feats stirred her insides budding a zeal to imitate by his life. She couldn't stop thinking about him. Even as she slept back home she would see him sprinting sitting amongst the awed audience.</p>
						<p>Her father was surprised when a day later she demanded a gift. This girl of 7 years had been a humble, obedient child with no vices of an infant. He was awestruck and happy to sanction her want. She demanded a pair of athletic shoes.</p>
																			

						<p>Since that day, it was all she ever dreamt of. It was all she ever cared about. She was fortunate enough, the government had abandoned due to 'program complexities', their plan to build a toll booth. The clever and resourceful girl that she was, now practiced on the abandoned road which was her very own theater of dreams.

						<p>Grappling the leftover straws,<br>
							Empty are my hands.<br>
							Hands are sore from searching<br>
							On red sprawling sand.</p>

							<p>The Earth brown still has marks<br>
							Her blood still soaked red.<br>
							She lay there, I found her,<br>
							Laying silent like on her bed.</p>

							<p>Killer absconds, I am not fond<br>
							Of events that have ensued.<br>
							I live, lie, lay, sit on ground,<br>
							People now call me shrewd.</p>

							<p>Khaki people tell me tales,<br>
							"Sir the trail has gone cold".<br>
							Boldly tread they in house, and say,<br>
							"On suspicion alone they cannot hold".</p>

							<p>The ground reeking of her sweat<br>
							I touch my ear to ground.<br>
							She shouts and screams, I can hear<br>
							Her screeching and her wailing sound.</p>

							<p>She must have pleaded, bleat like sheep<br>
							My poor, poor girl.<br>
							I'll give my tooth, strike a nail<br>
							Until the criminal unfurls.</p>
																 

							<p>The ‘MonsterMan’ ,TV calls him.<br>
							I sit in day, through night.<br>
							Hear them speak, repeat,<br>
							Explain the grisly sight.</p>

							<p>Closure, i seek I'll get<br>
							the day I kill him self<br>
							my mission is to search he who delves<br>
							torture and make him yelp<br>

						<h2>Women At Ages <span>Miheer Steward Das, School of Open Learning</span></h2>
						<p>In the womb I am and start to dream, <br>
					What should I do to be the cream. <br>
					A world of fortune is created for me, <br>
					Now a gripping seed , sooner the tree.</p>

					<p>Congrats to all for the daughter u got,<br> 
					what's sad about it like missing a shot.<br>
					All I felt is sicking at heart, <br>
					All I see is the happiness apart. <br>
					I tried so hard, no bliss in trace <br>
					Then found my dad smiling and gaze. </p>

					<p>The watch ticked to the first peddle<br>   
					His sweet little angel, out of the cradle <br>
					As school commences, I possess the first seat <br>
					Had lunch in the recess and stayed clean and neat.<br>
					That all I had known, unaware of the new,<br>
					The journey initiated with the knowledge so few.</p>

					<p>Ardor teen I am as the voyage's at the head,<br>
					Bringing me the challenges I fear no threat <br>
					I lay down the greens filled the eyes with blues<br>
					And fly like a sparrow coz' this wind seeks no rules<br>
					My thoughts are high as a pearl deep in the sea <br>
					Stop locking me up and set me free<br>
					Hate that chain which abandons the round,<br> 
					That grabby affection holds me down. </p>

					<p>A few decades more I own a family,<br>
					I pray for prestige and live happily. <br>
					That strong bond with you I live like fur,<br>
					As this mean life i fount like demur.<br>
					Every time I face a dilemma and mess,<br>
					I turned to be the leader with intellect and process.</p>
					 

					<p>At the edge of the End now as I stand <br>
					A glance of past no future to expand <br>
					No sacrifice of dreams nothing lest to be achieved<br>
					No compromise with life and success received<br>
					If something is left unchecked from the list, <br>
					This Eager soul of mine will rise from  mist. <br>
					In these few days I am gonna be alive, <br>
					To live a life as sweet as beehive. <br>
