						<h2>Life In The Metro <span></span></h2>
						<p>In the vast sea of people travelling through the lifeline of delhi i.e. the delhi metro, the ladies coach however, segregated from the others seems to have the most buzz. Well, the reason is pretty obvious - LADIES ! The female homo sapiens seem to be overly enthusiastic about their and everyone else's looks. So much so that gossip has become a word synonymous to all the girls in the world. 
					There isn't any weird fact about women that has remained unsaid so we won't delve into that "rocket science-y" realm. This article is about how personalities in the metro can be judged through just nine simple characteristics. </p>

					<p>#1 The I want that seat girl
					When all the seats are occupied(sometimes more than occupied) and you can't see a peck of space someone just comes in and says "please adjust :) " ...  what adjust ? I know we're Indians and adjustment is all we know but this! These kind of people are haughty , loud mouthed and totally self obsessed. They have this invisible crown and a tattoo on their head saying "I am my daddy's princess, I do not stand. "
					How to spot instantly : Loud , Loud , Loud. Both clothes and voice.</p>

					<p>#2 The Phoney Baloney girl
					"Haanji.. awaaz ni aari! Arrey.. metro me hu.. awaaz nhi ari.. "
					If there is a network problem then why don't u just put your phone down? Shouting incessantly and disturbing everyone else won't help you. These people are attention seekers. They just love to be the centre of everything , be it good or bad.
					How to spot instantly : phone glued to ears or earphones jammed into them.</p>

					<p>#3 The traffic jammers
					Yeah! Metro also has traffic jams. Even after repeatedly hearing."Do not sit on the floor of the train" people just don't get it. They just go and sit wherever feels nice and block everyone else's way. 
					How to spot instantly : Tired eyes. No hope of standing left, they'll either sit or fall. Give the damned woman a seat!</p>

					<p>#4 The gossip friends
					We LOVE to talk. About anything and everything. This is a universal fact. But every once in a while , the door opens and enters a group of friends who will be running a broadcast channel about "falani" Auntie's "dhimkana" beta . Sorry ! Not interested dude! 
					How to spot instantly : This one's easy. Keep your ears open :P</p>

					<p>#5 The crier
					Everyone is going through some problem or the other but public display of your emotions can never be justified. People just start crying in front of everyone and instead of consoling them , most people are either giving them looks or making the pity face. 
					How to spot instantly : Tears!</p>

					<p>#6 The girlfriend
					It's a common scenario to see couples standing at the interface between the two coaches , unabashed and unconcerned about everything else. It's actually the lover's point. So all the juliets meet their Romeos at the joint even though travelling in the general coach is always an option.
					How to spot instantly : public display of affection with the constant baby and jaanu!</p>

					<p>#7 The gundaa
					People are always in high airs about themselves and live in a bubble. These kind of people always have a manly walk and are hurting people as they pass by. They just shake their hands and legs unconcernedly even though they know about the immensity of the crowd.
					How to spot instantly : you can hear people say ooh! Ouch! As they walk by.</p>

						<h2>Prescriptive Morality
						 <span>K.V. Smitha, Hansraj College , DU</span></h2>
						<p>While  Pepsi  is  busy  belting  out  creative  taglines  which  never  fail  to  leave  a  smile  on  our  faces , the  leader  of  PepsiCo , its  parent  company  is  fighting  another  battle. ‘Oh  Yes  Abhi!’ , ‘Live  For  Now’, ‘More  Happy’ have  captured  the hearts  of  customers , and  encapsulate  the  essence  of  youth , vibrancy , perseverance , and  above  all ,  the  ‘Never  Say  Die’ spirit  promoting  equality  and  happiness. But  when  Indra  Nooyi,  CEO  of  PepsiCo,  famously  stated, “Women can’t  have  it  all.” It  was  one  of  those  moments, when  you  realize  that  the  utopian  version  of  equality  is  just  one  of  our  wild  fantasies.</p>
						<p>Just  when  people  had  started  ditching  feminism  for  the  world  ‘seemed’  to  move towards  equality, Nooyi’s  comments  have  brought  the  entire  corporate  stage  to  a standstill.  Her  painful  acceptance  of  the  fact  that  women  just  can’t  have  it  all, even  though  “…we  might  pretend  to.” , brings  to  the  fore,  various  issues  like gender  discrimination,  which  slowly  were  being  pushed  to  the  backburner.  The mother-child  relationship  is  the  worst  affected, as  per  Nooyi, who  believes  that “...the  biological  clock  and  the  career  clock  are  in  total  conflict… ” for  a  woman. ‘There  is  only  so  much  you  can  do.’, has  been, most  unfortunately,  glorified. The sense  of  resignation,  though  depressing,  has  been  echoed  by  many  women executives  like  Andrea  Thomas, CEO  of  ScratchMeNot,  Jen  Lee  Kos  of BRIKA.com,  and  Patricia  Campbell  of  LegalAdvice.com  among  others. The  cocktail  of  ambition  and  guilt  have,  since  ages,  been  portrayed  as  a  dangerous mix  for  women,  whose  sole  purpose  in  life  is  to  get  married  and  have  children (Pun , obviously , intended).  Choosing  between  building  a  career  and  being  a  full time  mother , is  more  of  a  battle  fought  in  the  mind. If  the  former  wins,  the woman  is  deemed  to  be  an  over  ambitious  bossy  bitch,  but  if  the  latter  wins (which  always  has  a  higher  probability), the  decision  is  deemed  as  ‘the  natural thing  to  do’.</p>
						<p>When  a  high  powered  woman  is  asked  to  ‘leave  her  crown’ at  the  garage,  and when  she  is  asked  to  fetch  milk  after  a  day’s  hard  work, it  pretty  much  sums  up  that  the  battle  is  already  lost. When  a  working  woman  is  bulldozed  with  snide remarks  about  her  parenting, it  is  almost  always  clear  that  she  had  it  coming.
					The  prescribed  code  laid  down  ages  ago,  says  that  women  aren’t  intended  to  do  what  the  men  do. Manusmriti,  a  holy  Hindu  text  from  the past, says  the following : Her  father  protects  her  in  childhood,  her  husband  protects  her  in  youth,  and  her  son  protects  her  in  old  age; a  woman  is  never  fit  for  independence.  Early  Christianity  deems  woman  as  ‘defective’  and  ‘misbegotten’. Several  scriptures  from  different  religions  have  stated  women  to  be  inferior  to men,  which  is  often  met  with  a  casual  shrug  by  men  even  today! The  immensity of  this  marginalization  of  women  is  unimaginable.  The  wall  is  so  thick ,  that  even  the  most  successful  women  finds  it  hard  to  believe  that  the  success  she has  attained  is  real. The 2003 Julia Roberts’ starrer ‘ Mona  Lisa  Smile’, subtly conveys  the  sorry  state  of  affairs  through  one  of  the  well  thought  dialogues , which  is  unfortunately  true:  A  good  wife  lets  her  husband  think  that  everything’s his  idea  even  when  it  is  not.
					So  basically  what  the  world  tell  us  is , “Don’t  you  worry! Everything  has  been written  down  for  you  to  follow.  Just  go  along  the  handbook.  But don’t  you  dare venture  outside  the  ‘prescribed’  book.  Just  play  the  role  for  which  you  were  born-  that  of  a  woman.  A  woman , who  is  not  allowed  to  think,  who  has  to accept  the  boundaries  as  set  by  the  men,  who  is  merely  the  dust  of  the  feet  of her  male  counterpart.”</p>
					<p>The  silver  lining  is  the  fact  that  ultimately,  what  is  normative,  is  almost  always JUNKED.
					The  question, therefore,  is  whether  we  agree  to  disagree?  The  economy  runs because  of  the  speculation  that  everything  goes  as  planned,  rockets  are  launched  because  the  scientists  are  sure  that  they  won’t  explode,  we  fall  in  love because  we  are  always  certain  of  ‘happily  ever  after’. Recessions  happen. Freak accidents  happen. Heartbreaks  happen.  Just  because  a  hugely  respected  leader says  the  truth, it  doesn’t  have  to  squash  our  hopes. It  doesn’t  have  to  be  a  battle  between  the  sexes. And  no,  it  doesn’t  have  to  be  an  agreement.  Nor  does it  have  to  be  feminism.  Stick  to  one’s  guns,  for  the  world  runs  on  hope. The  hope  for  a  free  world,  once  tagged  ‘utopian’,  materialized  after  centuries  of fighting  the  shackles  of  slavery.  Can  an  ‘equal  world’  be  far  behind?  I    believe not.

						<p>She jumped over the pole of the toll booth with a solitary halogen shining towards the ground, illuminating the area. The booth, fortunately had been defunct for about a year thereby making up for the dearth of a place to practice.</p>
						<p>One day her father promised to her as they dined to fulfill her wish to see cinema. A rare luxury, the remote town did not present many sources of amusement to the poor citizens of her village. She and her father chose to watch the 9 PM show of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.
						Engrossed, her eyes wouldn't budge from the screen. The ravishing graphics, the cloud of emotions and the undying spirit compelled her to absorb each frame and moment of the 3 hour long story. She was impressed and at the same time overwhelmed at the incredible presentation of the athlete's life. His feats stirred her insides budding a zeal to imitate by his life. She couldn't stop thinking about him. Even as she slept back home she would see him sprinting sitting amongst the awed audience.</p>
						<p>Her father was surprised when a day later she demanded a gift. This girl of 7 years had been a humble, obedient child with no vices of an infant. He was awestruck and happy to sanction her want. She demanded a pair of athletic shoes.</p>
																			

						<p>Since that day, it was all she ever dreamt of. It was all she ever cared about. She was fortunate enough, the government had abandoned due to 'program complexities', their plan to build a toll booth. The clever and resourceful girl that she was, now practiced on the abandoned road which was her very own theater of dreams.

						<p>In the womb I am and start to dream, <br>

					A world of fortune is created for me, <br>
					Now a gripping seed , sooner the tree.</p>

					<p>Congrats to all for the daughter u got,<br> 
					what's sad about it like missing a shot.<br>
					All I felt is sicking at heart, <br>
					All I see is the happiness apart. <br>
					I tried so hard, no bliss in trace <br>
					Then found my dad smiling and gaze. </p>

					<p>The watch ticked to the first peddle<br>   
					His sweet little angel, out of the cradle <br>
					As school commences, I possess the first seat <br>
					Had lunch in the recess and stayed clean and neat.<br>
					That all I had known, unaware of the new,<br>
					The journey initiated with the knowledge so few.</p>

					<p>Ardor teen I am as the voyage's at the head,<br>

					I turned to be the leader with intellect and process.</p>
					 

					<p>At the edge of the End now as I stand <br>
					A glance of past no future to expand <br>
					No sacrifice of dreams nothing lest to be achieved<br>
					No compromise with life and success received<br>
					If something is left unchecked from the list, <br>
					This Eager soul of mine will rise from  mist. <br>
					In these few days I am gonna be alive, <br>

						<h2>Beloved Mother <span>Decomposing fruits and burning houses</span></h2>
						<p>One night stands out—a gorgeous night—a carnival in honour and aid of brave little Serbia. Kipling says that "East is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet"; but he surely has not seen a Venetian carnival in Cairo, with its intermingling of the progressive Occident and the picturesque Orient. One will always remember that. When the tourists from the West overrun the land of the Pharaohs, as they do once a year, a Venetian fête is held at Shepheard's—the social event of the season. Sightseers from England, idle rich from the Continent, plutocrats from America, tourists from the four quarters of the world, all meet and make merry here. This year of grace witnessed a somewhat different spectacle, it is true. It was a polyglot gathering of all nations, to be sure, but the tourist element was wanting. In the place of the tourists, however, was the "Army of Occupation." Hundreds of officers, British, French, Egyptian, Australian and New Zealand, in smart uniforms, gave striking colour to the scene, which was made additionally picturesque by the vari-coloured silks and satins, scarfs and veils of the ladies. The garden was a blaze of splendour. There were the flags of the nations, there were flowers and palms and purling fountains, mirth and music, lights and laughter, and over all—confetti. All night the air was thick with confetti, like snow falling off a rainbow. Revellers flew hither and thither, flinging it everywhere. Merry maidens threw handfuls of confetti and eyesful of bold glances at the sun-tanned colonials. There was no respite until the ground was ankle-deep with confetti.</p>
						<p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for ever—and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful! Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader, do not waste your sympathies on us. It was tiresome work, marching, training—training for the front, which for months never seemed to get any nearer, and some of "the boys"—those of them who were "spoiling for a fight," as the saying is—used at times to kick over the traces and paint the town vermilion; but there are compensations in Egypt for all who would seek them. What did it matter that we had no hot cross buns for Easter, no hard-boiled eggs, no ling, no salmon? We had omelettes and quail on toast, and chicken and curry and strawberries (no cream) and oranges and custard and jelly and Turkish coffee and Nile fish and pancakes and fritters and iced butter and beautiful jam and marmalade—and cigars. So we managed to get "a snack," you see. And I know that I, for one, had no desire just then to swap places with any man in Australia.</p>
						<p>It was night when we got back to camp. Oh, those Egyptian nights! The winter cold has gone, and spring is in the air. The nights are fine and fair, clear and cloudless, with the moon pure silver. The reflections in the Nile are just wonderful. The huge date palms stand out sharply from a star-spangled sky that somehow has a tint of green in its blue. One thinks of the Arabian Nights. The very street scenes make one think of them. Motors glide up and down the streets with rich Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Italians, Frenchmen and Englishmen, going to the Continental, or to Shepheard's, or to private entertainments. It is a gorgeous splash of colour. They had no motor-cars that I remember in those old Arabian Nights, but the magic of the thing and the colour of it all were surely much the same. And the roads of Egypt—how beautiful they are!—clean and smooth as a billiard table. Are there any finer roads in the whole world than the Mena road and that to Heliopolis? Fifty miles an hour is easy. I sometimes shudder now when I recall the races that we used to have along those roads at night, crying "Egre! Egre!"—Faster! Faster!</p>

						<p>One charge was led by a doctor; another by a priest. Several times they charged so fiercely that they looked like getting out of hand. Scorning cover, they also scorned rifle fire. They scaled the steel-lined heights like demons. It was the bayonet all the time. One huge farmer actually bayoneted a Turk through the chest and pitchforked him over his shoulder. The man who performed this feat was a huge Queenslander—Sergeant Burne, of the 9th Battalion, who was afterwards wounded and returned to his Australian home—a man whose modesty is as great as his size. We smiled at first when we heard the story, and people in England and Australia read of it with amazement. But Sergeant Burne, standing over six feet high, and massively proportioned, looks quite capable of the feat. He himself tells the story in these words: "It is not a case for me to take any credit at all," he said. "I was in the platoon that landed first on the right. Our lieutenant was the first man to get ashore—and as game a man as ever faced fire. I followed him. I was ordered to take in hand a line of Turkish sharpshooters who were causing a lot of trouble. There was also a machine-gun on the hill. Somebody had to stop it. Myself and two lads went up, and we stopped it. That's all. There were ten Turks there. We got the Turks and we got the machine-gun, but I lost my two lads. They were only boys, but let me tell you the Australians are the best fighters in the world. One of the lads 'fixed' the German officer who was working the machine-gun. The Turks were higher up than we were, and I suppose that is how I was able to throw one of them over my shoulder. It's an old trick that is taught in the Guards."</p>

						<h2>Happiness <span>On self-sufficient homes and pets</span></h2>
						<p>The casualties among the officers were tremendous—brave men who led Australia's soldiers in that awful charge! And among the bravest of them were the young officers from the Duntroon Military College that stands amid delightful country surroundings near the capital of Federated Australia that is now in the making in the Mother State of New South Wales. These young fellows fought in a way that showed their native courage and the excellence of their training. Only the year before, when Sir Ian Hamilton, as Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces, visited Australia and inspected these lads who were training for the army at Duntroon, as the representative of the Sydney Morning Herald I remember seeing them laugh and cheer when Sir Ian Hamilton, on leaving Duntroon, jokingly wished them "plenty of wars and rapid promotion." And it seems only a few days since we were dancing and flirting in a Cairo ballroom. Now many of them lie sorely wounded at the base hospital, and several will never again hear the réveillé. But the College will not forget its firstfruits offered up so gladly for empire. Officers and men, it was all the same—they went to their death with a cheer for King and Country. I heard an Imperial officer, newly returned from Flanders, say that the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade was the finest brigade of infantry in the whole of the allied armies. In physique they were far superior to any of the British, French, or Belgian troops. Whether this be true or not, there is no doubt that the sturdy Thirds under Colonel Maclagan fought like Trojans on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and covered themselves with glory. Incidentally, I might mention, some of them never fired a shot during the fierce fighting of April 25. They simply trusted to the cold steel, and flung themselves at the Turkish trenches. The 1st Brigade (Colonel MacLaurin), the 2nd (Colonel McCay), and the rest of the Australians and New Zealanders fought with equal valour, but the brunt of the attack was borne by the Thirds. So many hundred gallant lives was a heavy price to pay for a footing in Gallipoli, but those impetuous charges, absolutely irresistible in their fury, would, we knew, bear rich fruit, for the Turks could never again withstand a bayonet charge by the Australians.</p>
						<p>To have gone through all they had gone through, and then to treat it all so lightly, seemed an extraordinary thing. All the doctors and nurses commented on the amazing fortitude and cheerfulness of the Australian wounded. I used to think the desire to be in the thick of things, that I had so often heard expressed, was make-believe, but I know better now. I used to say myself that I "wanted to be there" (and sotto voce I used to add "I don't think"); and now, in my heart-searchings, I began to wonder if I didn't really mean it, after all. I used to strike an attitude and quote, "One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name," whilst all the time I felt in my heart that I would prefer a crowded age of glorious life to an hour of fame. Now I began to wonder whether in my heart's core, in my very heart of hearts, I did not agree with the poet. The proper study of mankind is Oneself. And what was I doing there, anyway?</p>
						<p>And now, a hundred years after, we see French and British warships again off Alexandria. But this time the Union Jack and the Tricolour are intertwined, and in the streets of Alexandria French and British soldiers and sailors walk arm in arm, while the ancient city is gay with flags and bunting. For big things are brewing in the Levant. Before the eyes of the citizens during the past week was a unique international naval and military pageant—Zouaves, with their blue jackets and red trousers, French infantry in their blue-grey uniform, cavalry with gay tunics, British Jack Tars in blue and white, Australians in sombre khaki, swarthy-skinned Maoris from the Wonderland of the Southern Seas, and dusky warriors from the Punjab. British troops—and especially those young giants from Australia—had the better of the Frenchman in the matter of physique; but there was clear evidence of "grit" in the intelligent, humorous faces of the French, which helped one to understand why, for instance, they are said to be the finest marchers in Europe, and why the Germans never got to Paris!</p>
