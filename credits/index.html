						<h2>Note from the Branch Counselor<span>- Mrs. Yogita Arora</span></h2>
						<p>I'm delighted to introduce to you the 2015 online edition of Pratibimb, the official magazine of BVPIEEE, . Pratibimb has, since its inception, been a medium for students to express their views in the fields of technology, management, popular science, literature, etc. It has become a forum to disseminate information about advancement of technology and also about the endeavors of the IEEE Student Branch of BVCOE. </p>
						<p>The feedback for Pratibimb has always been overwhelming for the team and we're proud that it has continued to publish original contributions from its readers, be it in the Online Edition or the Fervour Edition. </p>
						<p>I congratulate the Pratibimb Team and appreciate them for showing such commendable dedication and efforts towards the development of this multi-dimensional magazine.</p>
						<p>Best Wishes.</p>

						<h2>Note from the Chairperson<span>- Yamini Jain</span></h2>
						<p>Welcome to the 2015 online edition of Pratibimb, the official biannual magazine of BVPIEEE. BVPIEEE has always strived to cater to multi-dimensional interests and has stayed true to that motto with Pratibimb, which records contributions from students all across Delhi and 'reflects' their literary abilities.</p>
						<p>BVPIEEE, since its advent almost 9 years ago, has always promoted IEEE as a platform to share knowledge through interactive sessions, seminars, conferences and field trips, thereby staying true to the essence of IEEE. It has been a learning process more than anything and throughout this course, we at the student branch have successfully conducted various technical events in every academic session, winning awards and recognition in the process. More than that, it has been the establishment of a talent pool where students interact and exchange ideas with people from various institutes and disciplines, that makes us proud. We aim to further expand the branch in the near future and are looking forward to conduct one of our premier events - the annual fest 'Fervour'  with enthusiasm and zeal. Another successful flagship event of BVPIEEE is 'Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Rotating Shield Quiz' which has been extremely successful.</p>
						<p>We release, with utmost pride and enthusiasm, the newest edition of Pratibimb with promise of an even bigger published edition during Fervour. For any further queries and reviews, feel free to contact us. We look forward to a positive response in the near future and hope your association with BVPIEEE will be an enriching experience.</p>
						<p>Regards,<br>Yamini Jain (Chairperson)</p>

						<h2>Note from the Editorial Desk <span>- Dharvi Verma & Mahika Bhasin</span></h2>
						<p>In the truest sense of the word, Pratibimb reflects the essence of BVPIEEE. The remarkable details of the Student Branch have been captured and highlighted here to give the readers a look into what goes into the makings of a team so diverse, a team so enthusiastic and a team which is always eager to learn. Striving for perfection, BVPIEEE has added new feathers to its cap through the inception of various new chapters whilst maintaining the treasured traditions of the past. The magazine documents the glories of the past, celebrates the accomplishments of the present and emphasises the hopes for a tomorrow which will be full of challenges.</p>
						<p>We express our sincere gratitude towards our Principal, Dr. Dharmender Saini, Branch Counselor, Mrs. Yogita Arora and Lambda Eta-Chapter Branch Counselor, Prof. Rahul Bahl, for their unflinching support, constant encouragement and guidance.</p>
						<p>Online or in print, working for Pratibimb has never felt like work for the Editorial Teams over the years. As they say, it’s not work if you love it. This year has been the same, with the team having put their best foot forward to piece together this compendium of articles, poems, sonnets, limericks and anecdotage. The Editorial Team couldn’t have brought out this edition without the support of the Web Designing Team which has worked for days to prepare the lovely design and layout.</p>
						<p>With these few words, I’m delighted to present to you the Pratibimb Online Edition 2015, in the sincere hope that you will enjoy reading it.</p>
						<p>Literally yours,<br>Dharvi Verma<br>Mahika Bhasin<br>Editor-In-Chief<br>Pratibimb Online Edition</p>

						<h3>Editor-In-Chief</h3>
						<p><img src="img/Team/mahika_bhasin.jpg" align="left" style="clip: rect(0px,60px,200px,0px);"><b>Mahika Bhasin</b> is like walking- sunshine. She wears her heart on her sleeve, is extremely wise for her age and loves writing. Very focused and helpful, Mahika is someone you can rely on. And she’s got a smile to kill for. </p>
						<p><img src="img/Team/dharvi_verma.jpg" align="left" height="60px" width="60px"><b>Dharvi Verma</b> is a vivacious girl who spreads happiness everywhere. Confident, hardworking, passionate and creative, Dharvi loves to wield her pen to express her thoughts. She loves to work, wants to go places and learn as much as she can. But, there’s a special place for Roger Federer in her heart. If things go in her favour, she might even ask him to marry her. Watch out! (Oh, wait. He is married!)</p>
						<h3>Executive Editor</h3>
						<p><img src="img/Team/payal_mangla.jpg" align="left" height="60px" width="60px"><b>Payal Mangla</b> is a TV series fan. A bibliophile, she can go on and on and on about books and seasons and probably never stop! She knows what to say, when to say, when to be honest and when to lie. She is deep into science and literature. She is mad about Roger, Messi and lan Somerhalder!</p>
						<p><img src="img/Team/hemangini_malhotra.jpg" align="left" height="60px" width="60px"><b>Hemangini Malhotra</b> loves to explore new stuff! She is a satisfied soul in every sense of the word!

						<p><img src="img/Team/kanika_sharma.jpg" align="left" height="60px" width="60px">For <b>Kanika Sharma</b> all things in life happen by chance and not through plans, she quips. She is the poster child for a kid who is confused about what she wants from life yet loves to enjoy it at all times. She might come across as an airhead but she loves to observe people (while making weird faces). With the life motto of “Love to hate and hate to love”, she wishes to one day break the mould of the quintessential middle class families that a “safe” career is a guarantee of a happy life.</p>

						<p><img src="img/Team/shreshtha_jain.jpg" align="left" height="60px" width="60px"><b>Shreshtha Jain </b>is a simple and a benevolent person. She’s a good cook too!
